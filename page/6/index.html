<div class="post-info"><span class="date published time" title="2012-01-04T10:00:33+00:00">January 4, 2012</span>  by <span class="author vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="../../author/sarah/index.html" rel="author">sarah</a></span></span>  </div>			<div class="thesis_post_image">

			</div>
			<div class="entry-content"><p>Man oh man&#8230;I cannot BELIEVE it&#8217;s already 2012! I need to get this year started off right, so I&#8217;m actually going to create some very attainable resolutions for myself.</p>
<p>1. WORKOUT!!!! Yes, I have lost all my baby weight (+5 pounds), which means I&#8217;m actually at my ultimate goal weight and I was NOT at that weight pre-preggo. However, I&#8217;m thinking the main reason I&#8217;m at my ultimate goal weight is because I have lost a lot of muscle mass&#8230;? Hahaha&#8230;I&#8217;m not sure this is actually the reason, but my workouts have been few and far between. In July, I started the post-baby weight loss process and hit it hard, including at least 2 sessions of bikram yoga a week mixed in with cardio and weights. I had a great routine that I was really happy with until the end of August, when my hubby took a new job and was out of town Mon.-Fri . I mean, who wants to work out after taking care of a baby ALL day by yourself???? NOT ME!!!! His traveling has calmed down a LOT, so I&#8217;m joining the YMCA and going to get back into fighting shape!</p>
<p>2. BLOG!!!! When us gals started this blog in 2009 it was a fabulous creative outlet, but I obviously put writing on the back burner when baby C came along in March. I work full-time from home and between managing my baby, work, and house-hold chores, I never really got a good grasp to make time for ANY creative outlets. This is ALL changing. I&#8217;m literally forcing myself to get back on track because it&#8217;s a great way to get your thoughts out AND to fake shop&#8230;I mean, lets face it, it&#8217;s hard to justify that uber-cute new spring wardrobe when you have a new little one, but it will never hurt to look! 🙂</p>
<p>Happy 2012 everyone!</p>

<div class="post-info"><span class="date published time" title="2012-01-04T06:00:43+00:00">January 4, 2012</span>  by <span class="author vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="../../author/court/index.html" rel="author">court</a></span></span>  </div><div class="entry-content"><p>This where I insert my excuse for going MIA for a number of months 🙂  Life happens, right?  But this is a great post that&#8217;s always fun to do and lets me verbal vomit about my life in the last year.  So here goes it&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>1. What did you do in 2011 that you’d never done before?</strong></p>
<p>Entered and completed a 10k and lived to write about it.  HAHAA.</p>
<p><strong>2. Did you keep your new year’s resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</strong></p>
<p>I would say that I didn&#8217;t technically meet my resolution of losing the amount of weight that I wanted, but I am pumped for the new year.</p>
<p><strong>3. Did anyone close to you give birth? </strong></p>
<p>OMG did they ever.  Sarah and AK both in one year.  It&#8217;s been a lot of baby talk round these parts.</p>
<p><strong>4. Did anyone close to you die?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I had a cousin pass in July.  Very sad situation that really rattled my family.  Unfortunately my Aunt also died just last month while in the hospital under going heart surgery.  You just have to buckle down as a family and push through the good and the bad.  There was more bad this year than I would have liked.</p>
<p><strong>5. What countries did you visit?</strong></p>
<p>JAMAICA BABY.  Ben&#8217;s sis got married in Montego Bay and we were able to have a really badass vacation there in turn.  Snorkling was my favorite activity there.</p>
<p><strong>6. What would you like to have in 2012 that you didn’t have in 2011?</strong></p>
<p>A siamese cat that magically gets over his little man, I hate every other cat in the house so I am going to piss in a pile of clothes act.</p>
<p><strong>7. What dates from 2011 will be etched upon your memory, and why?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately my cousins death on July 27, 2011.  We were very close for a number of years and again, just took the whole thing pretty hard.  It was a very senseless situation.</p>
<p>I hate that the one thing that sticks out in my mind is a really bad event, but its what I think of first.</p>
<p><strong>8. What was your biggest achievement of this year?</strong></p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t entirely complete because the school is not over, but&#8230;.volunteering to be and acting as homeroom mom.  With that comes organization of all class parties and field day.  It&#8217;s also given me more time with Austin at a time when he is really starting to naturally become more independent.   So far is been a lot of fun and I&#8217;ve been able to be front row for all of Austin&#8217;s activities at school.</p>
<p><strong>9. What was your biggest failure?</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have anything that I look back and said that I completely failed on.  There are times I have acted in ways that I shouldn&#8217;t have though.</p>
<p><strong>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</strong></p>
<p>If sick is being defined as an illness or injury that actually had you down,  I do not believe I was sick one single time in 2011.  Tipsy ladies, feel free to correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p><strong>11. What was the best thing you bought?</strong></p>
<p>A new TV for our bedroom.  I had thought before that I really didn&#8217;t care about TVs, until I got a nice upgraded one to watch my Law and Orders on.</p>
<p><strong>12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</strong></p>
<p>Ben was great with all the deaths and goings on this year.  You know simple things like just sitting with someone at the hospital or in a funeral service make the world of difference.  You know that you have someone there that is giving you 100% of their support.</p>
<p>Another person that has totally blown me away is my dear friend Der.  Its been pretty amazing watching her take a natural gift and be able to turn into a career that makes everyone of her customers so happy.  Shes truly got something good going there.</p>
<p><strong>13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?</strong></p>
<p>Blah.</p>
<p><strong>14. Where did most your money go? </strong></p>
<p>Its honestly felt like Austin ate, literally ate in food, my paycheck.  What little was left went to Austin&#8217;s first football season.  What a great experience and GREAT people watching.  Soccer was nothing compared to these characters.</p>
<p><strong>15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?</strong></p>
<p>I did/am totally wrapped up in the excitement of watching my best friends with their babies.  Its been a lot of fun to see all tha&#8217; boys and its also fun that we are all boy moms now, some of us for the second time.  Its a very special club.</p>
<p><strong>16. What song will always remind you of 2011?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;What Sarah Said&#8221; by Death Cab for Cutie</p>
<p><strong>17.</strong> <strong>Compared to this time last year, are you: a) happier or sadder? b) thinner or fatter? c) richer or poorer?</strong></p>
<p>Happier still.  It&#8217;s still been a fun year and I have the best people in my life.</p>
<p>Actually if you get down to technicalities, I am thinner&#8211;but not by much!</p>
<p>Same.</p>
<p><strong>18. What do you wish you’d done more of?</strong></p>
<p>Traveling.  Its so nice to get out and see new places and experience new things.  I want to do more of that in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>19. What do you wish you’d done less of?</strong></p>
<p>Worrying about things I can&#8217;t change.</p>
<p><strong>20. How did you spend Christmas?</strong></p>
<p>In Houston with my family and Ben&#8217;s family.  Christmas Eve is at my parents place with all of my Mom&#8217;s side of the family.  Its a fun and extremely loud and obnoxious gathering.  One of my Aunts threatened to &#8220;slap the shit&#8221; out of another one of my Aunts this year, so that&#8217;s always a good laugh.</p>
<p><strong>21. Did you fall in love with 2011?</strong></p>
<p>I think in any relationship you continue to get closer and closer when its going good.  So I would definitely say with Ben.  CHEESE BALL!</p>
<p><strong>22. What was your favorite TV program?</strong></p>
<p>DUDE&#8230;.I seriously have an issue.  All I watch is Law and Order on DVDs.  Now that I have been through all of the Law and Order: SVUs,  I have moved on to the orignal Law and Orders.  I am seriously an addict.</p>
<p><strong>23. Do you hate anyone now that you didn’t hate this time last year?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>24. What was the best book you read?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely fell head over heels for the Hunger Games Trilogy.</p>
<p><strong>25. What was your greatest musical discovery?</strong></p>
<p>Sarah Jaffe. Actually Ben discovered her for me and took me to a concert.  She&#8217;s amazing and a REALLY chill.</p>
<p><strong>26. What did you want and get?</strong></p>
<p>You know I decided to look for a job in January of 2011 and in less than a month I landed a job that I absolutely love.  I think that was my best catch this year.</p>
<p><strong>27. What did you want and not get?</strong></p>
<p>Nothing I can even think of.</p>
<p><strong>28. What was your favorite film of 2010?</strong></p>
<p>I am going to go with&#8230;.Limitless.  It had me tuned in from the second it started.</p>
<p><strong>29. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</strong></p>
<p>On my 31st birthday Ben took me to a concert and then surprised me with a bunch of my friends that were already at a bar waiting for me to ring in the big 3-1.  I really felt like it was &#8220;my day&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>30. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</strong></p>
<p>I think a TAD more organization would have helped.  I don&#8217; think I am in immense need, but I started off the new year by organizaing all of my jewelry.  My next battle is my closet.  So I have high hopes to get more organized. 🙂</p>
<p><strong>31. How would you describe your personal fashion concept of 2010?</strong></p>
<p>Patterns and bangles.  I did a lot of thrift shopping this year as well.</p>
<p><strong>32. What kept you sane?</strong></p>
<p>The good and bad and up and downs of raising and being as involved as I can with Austin.  Its been work for Ben and I together as well.  Its definitely a learning process that never stops.</p>
<p><strong>33. What political issue stirred you the most?</strong></p>
<p>When that TV reporter had some type of seizure or something and was talking all crazy.  That stirred me real good.  Google it.  Thank me later.</p>
<p><strong>34. Who did you miss?</strong></p>
<p>I miss working my old co-workers, they were a really fun crew.  They have all also moved on to other jobs since then as well.  Its just so important to have people that make you laugh, you can talk to and rely on at work.  I spend more time at work than anywhere else, so that kind of thing is important to me.</p>
<p><strong>35. Who was the best new person you met?</strong></p>
<p>On Austin&#8217;s football team there are twin boys (age 10) that we have gotten to know during this year.  I have to say they are so damn cool and have a way of making you look at things in a totally different perspective.  They have two of the sweetest personalities and couldn&#8217;t have a better outlook on things, considering that haven&#8217;t had the best home life.</p>
<p><strong>36. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2011.</strong></p>
<p>That you really should try to make the best of each relationship, day, conversation.</p>
<p><strong>37. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year.</strong></p>
<p><em>Love is watching someone die.— Death Cab for Cutie</em></p>

<p>That everything my parents ever told me about having children is 100% true, and I never imagined you could love another human as much as I love my son. (Mushy, I know&#8230;) 🙂</p>
<p><strong>37. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year.</strong></p>
<p><em>“Life&#8217;s not the breath you take, the breathing in and out, that gets you through the day, ain&#8217;t what it&#8217;s all about. You just might miss the point, trying to win the race. Life&#8217;s not the breaths you take, but the moments that take your breath away&#8230;” — George Strait</em></p>

			<div class="entry-content"><p>Last year I made <a href="../../2011/01/new-years-resolutions-ak-2011/index.html">resolutions</a>, which truly hasn&#8217;t been my thing most of my life.  I made resolutions the year before and didn&#8217;t keep a lot of them, but last year&#8230;well, last year I kept them and I don&#8217;t think it was a conscious thing. I think I made a list that was actually feasible.  I was downright surprised when I realized while doing <a href="../../2011/12/new-years-survey-ak-2/index.html">my survey </a>this year that I had kept all my resolutions.  So I&#8217;m going to attempt the same thing this year, let&#8217;s see if this works&#8230;</p>
<ol>
<li>STAY in shape. Don&#8217;t gain the weight back. I totally think this is do-able. I could stand to lose maybe 5-7 more pounds, but I&#8217;m not going to push my luck.  If I end this year the way I started it, weight wise, I&#8217;ll be happy.</li>
<li>Wear more RED nail polish. You think this is easy&#8230;however, it&#8217;s really not.  See&#8230;this year has been nutso, crazy busy and I didn&#8217;t get many manicures.  If I don&#8217;t get manicures, I bite my nails.  It&#8217;s as simple as that. I have no other solution for the nail biting besides manicures, it&#8217;s the only thing that has worked my whole life.  So if I&#8217;m biting my nails then my nails aren&#8217;t long enough for a color.  You may ask, what is long enough? I&#8217;m talking beyond the nubs people.</li>
<li>READ! I love reading good books.  I need to make the time. Somehow. Last year&#8217;s reading status was pathetic.</li>
</ol>
<p>So there you have it! I think I can make that happen.  I&#8217;m going easy on myself this year because why not? I owe it to myself.</p>

<div class="post-info"><span class="date published time" title="2011-12-30T14:10:04+00:00">December 30, 2011</span>  by <span class="author vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="../../author/der/index.html" rel="author">der</a></span></span>  </div><div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Hello blogworld. It&#8217;s been a while and I apologize for that. It&#8217;s been an interesting, super duper busy, crazy, fabulous year and I think I need to get back on the Tipsy track so all y&#8217;all can know about it! And I&#8217;m going to start with my New Year&#8217;s survey! </strong></p>
<p><strong>1. What did you do in 2011 that you’d never done before?</strong></p>
<p>I went back to school. Which sucked and was awesome at the same time. Sucked bc it was school and juggling that with a baby&#8230; but was awesome feeling  to know I could get back in the swing of those things again and actually pass:)</p>
<p>I also started my own photography biz. It&#8217;s really taken off and I couldn&#8217;t be more proud of myself. It&#8217;s really awesome to be doing something that you love and getting paid for it.</p>
<p><strong>2. Did you keep your new year’s resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</strong></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have anything really specific last year. Going to school was a big one and I did that.</p>
<p><strong>3. Did anyone close to you give birth?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>So so many peeps: AK, Sarah&#8230; many, many friends. 2011 was a year of babies.</p>
<p><strong>4. Did anyone close to you die?</strong></p>
<p>No, thankfully we were able to skip out on any deaths this year.</p>
<p><strong>5. What countries did you visit?</strong></p>
<p>Um, none. Same answer as last year. We didn&#8217;t do any traveling really at all this year, but I certainly hope to change that and take AJ on his first real family vacay in 2012!</p>
<p><strong>6. What would you like to have in 2012 that you didn’t have in 2011?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m venturing to say maybe pregnancy #2&#8230;.still reeling the hubs in on that one though:)</p>
<p><strong>7. What dates from 2010 will be etched upon your memory, and why?</strong></p>
<p>October 7th&#8230; my baby turned one. I&#8217;m so in love with him and with being a mother. I never knew something could feel so right, but it does.</p>
<p><strong>8. What was your biggest achievement of this year?</strong></p>
<p>Putting myself out there with the photog biz. It was a really big step for me to think that someone would actually want to pay me to take their photo. I&#8217;m starting to think maybe all my friends and fam weren&#8217;t crazy when they pushed me to do this.</p>
<p><strong>9. What was your biggest failure?</strong></p>
<p>I would have to say letting stress get to me. I think sometimes I need to focus more on the big picture and not on the small things.</p>
<p><strong>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</strong></p>
<p>No, I didnt have too many illnesses or issues, but poor baby AJ was an ear infected fool for a few months there.</p>
<p><strong>11. What was the best thing you bought?</strong></p>
<p>My iphone 4 upgrade. I couldn&#8217;t live without it. My new camera equipment.</p>
<p><strong>12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</strong></p>
<p>My husband&#8230; he has his moments of bitchiness of course, but he works so so hard for our family and provides us with everything we want and need. I know I am so very lucky to have someone who cares about my happiness the way he does.</p>
<p><strong>13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?</strong></p>
<p>High road once again.</p>
<p><strong>14. Where did most your money go?</strong></p>
<p>Holy crap, totally baby. And all his crap.</p>
<p><strong>15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?</strong></p>
<p>Seeing AJ pass all his milestones: sitting, walking, talking&#8230; he&#8217;s grown to have the most amazing personality and he just gets cuter by the minute.</p>
<p><strong>16. What song will always remind you of 2012?</strong></p>
<p>Eli Young Band &#8220;Crazy Girl&#8221;&#8230; my hubs is a die hard fan and he also plays guitar. I prob heard his rendition of this song 87,001 times.</p>
<p><strong>17.</strong> <strong>Compared to this time last year, are you: a) happier or sadder? b) thinner or fatter? c) richer or poorer?</strong></p>
<p>Infinitely Happier….I&#8217;m doing something I love, have a wonderful family</p>
<p>Thinner.. .Finally kicked all that pesky baby weight and then some&#8230; somehow things still don&#8217;t look the same, but I&#8217;ll take it:)</p>
<p>A Little Richer…  Hubs got a well deserved promo, my biz is taking off&#8230; I&#8217;m pretty proud to say I think we are doing ok!</p>
<p><strong>18. What do you wish you’d done more of?</strong></p>
<p>Taken more photos of AJ as a tiny baby. I miss that little lump and I didn&#8217;t go total picture crazy until he was maybe 6 months old</p>
<p><strong>19. What do you wish you’d done less of?</strong></p>
<p>Saying NO. I feel like that&#8217;s AJ&#8217;s new name. But I think that just comes with the mischievous boy territory.</p>
<p><strong>20. How did you spend Christmas?</strong></p>
<p>With family at several different houses. The hubs even surprised me and AJ by getting off early on Christmas Eve to show up at the family celebration for my side of the family.</p>
<p><strong>21. Did you fall in love with 2011?</strong></p>
<p>Oh my goodness. Yes. I love my family and it was a great year with the 3 of us.</p>
<p><strong>22. What was your favorite TV program?</strong></p>
<p>Modern Family, Private Practice and dont laugh&#8230; Teen Mom.</p>
<p><strong>23. Do you hate anyone now that you didn’t hate this time last year?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t hate anyone. Ever. I just don&#8217;t really &#8220;get&#8221; some people, but I would never say hate.</p>
<p><strong>24. What was the best book you read?</strong></p>
<p>Psssh, read. Nope. None.</p>
<p><strong>25. What was your greatest musical discovery?</strong></p>
<p>I always like a good country song and a few of those new ones got me.</p>
<p><strong>26. What did you want and get?</strong></p>
<p>To stay home with my son, to start a business</p>
<p><strong>27. What did you want and not get?</strong></p>
<p>Nada. I&#8217;m pretty content.</p>
<p><strong>28. What was your favorite film of 2011?</strong></p>
<p>I am so behind on movies. SO BEHIND. I promise to catch up in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>29. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</strong></p>
<p>I turned 27 and I went out out for the first time post baby. It was a really good time.</p>
<p><strong>30. </strong><strong>What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</strong></p>
<p>Less sweating the small stuff. Otherwise it was a pretty stellar year.</p>
<p><strong>31. How would you describe your personal fashion concept of 2011?</strong></p>
<p>Casual. I lived in rolled jeans and fitted tees, flops and flats and tiny jewelry unable to be ripped off by an infant. It&#8217;s really interesting to see how much motherhood really has changed my style. I&#8217;m much more casual and sporty than I used to be. It&#8217;s about comfort and function people&#8230; ok, and it has to be cute too:)</p>
<p><strong>32. What kept you sane?</strong></p>
<p>My husband. My mom. Daily phone convos and IM chats with my best gals. Sometimes you just need to vent.</p>
<p><strong>33. What political issue stirred you the most?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t do politics.</p>
<p><strong>34. Who did you miss?</strong></p>
<p>I think maybe a little bit of adult interaction. I love being at home with my son, but a little adult convo is much appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>35. Who was the best new person you met?</strong></p>
<p>All these babies. I love babies.</p>
<p><strong>36. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2010.</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes life takes you in directions you never imagined. And that&#8217;s a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>37. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Your little hand&#8217;s wrapped around my finger<br />
And it&#8217;s so quiet in the world tonight<br />
Your little eyelids flutter cause you&#8217;re dreaming<br />
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light<br />
To you everything&#8217;s funny, you got nothing to regret<br />
I&#8217;d give all I have, honey<br />
If you could stay like that&#8221;</p>
<p>-Taylor Swift</p>

<div class="post-info"><span class="date published time" title="2011-12-30T12:49:11+00:00">December 30, 2011</span>  by <span class="author vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="../../author/ak/index.html" rel="author">ak</a></span></span>  </div><div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s that time of year again! Let&#8217;s put the year in review! Here&#8217;s <a href="../../2010/01/new-years-survey-ak/index.html">2009</a> and <a href="../../2010/12/new-years-survey-ak-2010/index.html">2010</a>.</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>What did you do in 2011 that you’d never done before?</strong>Lots of firsts this year&#8230;I learned to juggle two kids.  We had a brand new baby boy in May and our first born turned 3 in October.  And for those of you with multiple kids, you know, it’s just a learn as you go thing…will you give each of them enough attention etc, etc.  We seem to be doing alright.
<p>My husband and I had also started our own <a href="http://comalproductions.com/">business</a> about 2 years ago, but he also worked a 9-5 job as well.  This was the year that our own business took over and he no longer works the 9-5. Fingers crossed!</p>
<p>Also, we entered the land of preschool! Very weird to take your child to a place and DROP THEM OFF and LEAVE and it’s not like my mom’s house or something…that took some getting used to!</li>
<li><strong>Did you keep your new year’s resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</strong><br />
It looks like these were mine from <a href="../../2011/01/new-years-resolutions-ak-2011/index.html">last year</a>:<em>Get in shape after having the baby-</em>I DEFINITELY did this and am very proud of myself.  Both my husband and myself workout regularly, eat better…all the hard stuff that you do to lose weight. We both lost about 25-30lbs.</p>
<p><em>Take More Pictures, specifically so the new baby has baby pictures-</em>YES! I did take a lot of pictures of the new addition to our family…even though they may have just been iPhone pics. Note to self, use the better camera more often.</p>
<p><em>Get craftier-</em>YES! I had help but I did make the baby clothes quilt that I had in sight.  It took most of the year and I learned to sew by doing it! Once I had the sewing down I managed to make some of the other Tipsy gals <a href="http://www.stylescrapbook.com/2011/03/diy-yellow-clutch.html">clutch purses</a> for Christmas and some fleece hats for the kiddos.</p>
<p><em>Keep organized along the way-</em>Yes and No. I organized little things along the way like junk drawers and butler’s pantry and stuff like that but I also had my closet get completely unmanageable and I had to do a complete overhaul.</p>
<p>I think I will definitely make a couple for next year and see how that goes, maybe I’m on a roll.</li>
<li><strong>Did anyone close to you give birth?</strong>Me! And <a href="../../sarah.1.html">Sarah</a>! And my sister-in-law!</li>
<li><strong>Did anyone close to you die?</strong>We had to put our little Chihuahua, Weezie, down this year.  She’d been with me a while—pre-kids and pre-husband.  She was feisty that one. The vet told us that she&#8217;s definitely one he will remember. I choose to believe that was because she challenged him. ha!</li>
<li><strong>What countries did you visit?</strong>None. But we did make a trip to Oklahoma to meet <a href="http://www.elleinadspir.com/">Danielle</a> in person! We had a great time, thanks Danielle!!</li>
<li><strong>What would you like to have in 2012 that you lacked in 2011?</strong>Oh I would so love to move into a new house, we’ve completely outgrown ours.  We’ll see what the future holds.</li>
<li><strong>What dates from 2011 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?</strong>Having another baby…for obvious reasons.</li>
<li><strong>What was your biggest achievement of the year?</strong>Probably losing the weight, it was hard, but it was worth it and I want to be healthy for my family.</li>
<li><strong>What was your biggest failure?</strong>This question depresses me. I mean we all do things/say things that we look back on and think of it as being a failure, including me…especially me because I’m sort of a perfectionist. But you live and learn right? Everything is a lesson.</li>
<li><strong>Did you suffer illness or injury?</strong>DUDE. So, since my 3 year old started preschool in August it’s like this whole house has been sick umpteen times.</li>
<li><strong>What was the best thing you bought?</strong>We got an iPad this year and it has hands down been the best purchase.  Officially it’s my husband’s, but my son uses it a TON and I use it EVERY now and then…I’m thinking I kinda need one for myself.</li>
<li><strong>Whose behavior merited celebration?</strong>My first born…we threw a lot of things at him this year including a new brother, a new big boy bed, preschool, and potty training. I think dude deserves a party.</li>
<li><strong>Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?</strong>People surprise you, take you off guard…but again, live and learn right?</li>
<li><strong>Where did most of your money go?</strong>Health insurance and related baby birthing expenses.</li>
<li><strong>What did you get really excited about?</strong>Introducing a new little guy into the world and seeing how nobody can make him smile quicker or bigger than his big brother.</li>
<li><strong>What song will always remind you of 2011?</strong><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/moves-like-jagger-studio-recording/id447682785?i=447682985"> Moves Like Jagger</a>, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/hey-mama/id446384618?i=446384624">Hey Mama</a>, and anything by <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/hell-on-heels/id453486749">Pistol Annies</a></li>
<li><strong>Compared to this time last year, are you: </strong><strong>a)happier or sadder? </strong>Hmmm I’m not sure? More stressed?
<p><strong>b)thinner or fatter? </strong>THINNER! Yay! And not just because I had a baby, like thinner than before I got preggers. Let’s hope I can stay on this train…</p>
<p><strong>c)richer or poorer? </strong>The same? Or would that mean poorer because we’ve added a kid into the mix?</li>
<li><strong>What do you wish you’d done more of?</strong>This is going to sound super lame, but reading…I hardly read anything this year and that sucks.  Also, movie-going.  I do miss my pre-kids weekly trips to the movie theater.</li>
<li><strong>What do you wish you’d done less of? </strong>Worry. Stress about things.</li>
<li><strong>How did you spend Christmas?</strong>Christmas Eve we combined my family and my husband’s and did dinner at our house.  On the menu that night: beef enchiladas (made by me), beans (made by me), cilantro rice (made by my husband), skinny margs (made by my husband). Christmas Day we did our gifts/Santa in the morning and then went to my parent&#8217;s house for our traditional breakfast and presents, then home for the kids to nap and then went back around 4 for dinner and brought my husband&#8217;s mom along with us.  It was a great day.</li>
<li><strong>Did you fall in love in 2011?</strong>I always answer this one very cheesily…yes with my family! Our new little one is just super cute and chill and our oldest just gets cuter and smarter and more fascinating every single day. And I’m very proud of my husband on the business front, he’s doing a super great job and I just couldn’t have asked for a better guy.</li>
<li><strong>What was your favorite TV program?</strong>I for sure continue to love The Good Wife. I definitely love Parenthood. And I’m totally addicted to watching Greek on Netflix streaming.</li>
<li><strong>Do you hate anyone now that you didn’t hate this time last year?</strong>It’s a waste of time to spend energy hating.</li>
<li><strong>What was the best book you read?</strong>Like I said, I didn’t get to too many books this year. I did finish Black Heels to Tractor Wheels and Two Kisses for Maddy.  And then I started a few others but haven’t finished them: All That is Bitter &amp; Sweet, Waiting for Birdy, Seriously…I’m Kidding, and Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close.  I’ll get to them, hopefully this year.</li>
<li><strong>What was your greatest musical discovery?</strong>I continue to love Miranda Lambert and definitely love her new girl group Pistol Annies. And Martina McBride’s newest album is definitely different for her and I love the change, I’m back to being a fan.  But in terms of greatest musical discovery? That has to be my 3 year old who has taken to singing and dancing and dj’ing for us nonstop lately.  It has got to be the cutest thing I’ve ever seen…especially when he picks a song from my iTunes list and says, “Mama, I think you are gonna like this one…”</li>
<li><strong>What did you want and get?</strong>A healthy, happy baby boy.</li>
<li><strong>What did you want and not get?</strong>Nothing else matters…everything comes in its own time.</li>
<li><strong>What was your favorite film of this year?</strong>Without a doubt I loved Crazy, Stupid Love. And it wouldn’t be right if I didn’t throw in that I am still on the Twilight train and loved Breaking Dawn Part 1.</li>
<li><strong>What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</strong>Blah! I turned 36 and I had a dentist appointment. Though the next weekend my husband sent me on an all day spa day.  It was fabulous.</li>
<li><strong>What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</strong>Hmmm, probably more sleep, less stress and worry.</li>
<li><strong>How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2011?</strong>Jeggings and Skinny jeans came into the mix! I’m late to the game…</li>
<li><strong>What kept you sane?</strong>I have no idea. Maybe deep breaths and taking things day by day?</li>
<li><strong>Who was the best new person you met?</strong>Well of course our new little guy.  It’s amazing how in some ways he’s so different from our first and yet very, very similar.</li>
<li><strong>Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2011.</strong><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mobileweb/mike-robbins/compassion_b_1164090.html">&#8220;It&#8217;s important to remember that people are always doing the best they can, including you.&#8221;</a></li>
<li><strong>Quote a song lyric that sums up your year</strong>.Like I said earlier, we rounded the year out with a new baby and going out on our own business-wise, so I think this pretty much sums that up…<br />
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/these-are-the-days/id203144552?i=203144587">These Are the Days by Sugarland</a><br />
<em>“…</em><em>And we wake up wondering what might happen next</em><br />
<em>Yeah, sometimes it feels like we won&#8217;t make it through</em><br />
<em>But the hard times pass like the good ones do</em><br />
<em>Baby, wrap your fingers and hold on tight</em><br />
<em>I&#8217;ll be right here beside you tonight…</em><br />
<em>…We&#8217;re making moments we won&#8217;t forget</em><br />
<em>We fill in ones that haven&#8217;t happened yet…”</em></li>

<p>Last year I took an idea of <a href="http://whoorl.com/archives/4693">Whoorl’s</a> to showcase a year of iPhone pics, so I’m going to continue with that and show you pics I took with my phone along with instagrams. It’s a little longer this year, but hey, I love my family! I hope you enjoy it! And I hope everyone has a very Happy, Healthy and Prosperous New Year!</p>
