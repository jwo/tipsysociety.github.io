		<description><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s starting to get hot and humid here in Houston&#8230;in the 80s for the most part.  And my being pregnant means I feel about 20 degrees hotter than that.  I will be counting down the days until I can have my favorite drink to cool down: The Margarita.</p>
<p>Everyone reading this, please go and have a margarita for me!!  Come summer time I will be able to join you all!!</p>
<p>Fill up the Minute Maid container about 3/4 full with Mr &amp; Mrs T Margarita Mix and add to the blender.  Then fill the container 3/4 full with tequila* and add to the blender as well.  Add ice to the top of the blender container.  Blend and drink. You can pour into a glass or you could just drink it out of the blender pitcher.  Whichever you prefer.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Now, I won&#8217;t be adding any vodka to this (although I&#8217;d love to) but that is certainly a great idea.</p>
<p>Take one 2 qt. lemonade mix in a pitcher and instead of water, add club soda. Top that off with a cup of orange juice (I prefer the light, pulp free variety) and slice up some oranges, slap &#8217;em in there and let those babies exude their juicy goodness. Yumilicious, I tell ya.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>This is my tried and true Margarita recipe.  It&#8217;s super duper easy.  Get the large Minute Maid Frozen Limeade and squeeze it into the blender.  Fill up the Minute Maid container about 3/4 full with Mr &amp; Mrs T Margarita Mix and add to the blender.  Then fill the container 3/4 full with tequila* and add to the blender as well.  Add ice to the top of the blender container.  Blend and drink. You can pour into a glass or you could just drink it out of the blender pitcher.  Whichever you prefer.</p>
<p>*Centenario Anejo tequila is by far the best tequila my husband and I have encountered.  It&#8217;s definitely our &#8220;good&#8221; tequila that we always have on hand.  You can use whatever kind of tequila you prefer.</p>

The reason for this, aside from the obvious (buying groceries), we go for the SAMPLES and the WINE.  We taste tested this recipe this past Sunday and LOVED it.  LOVED it so much that we bought the wine that you use to make it and nabbed the recipe.</p>
<p>1 bottle <a href="http://fincaelorigen.blogspot.com/">Finca El Origen Torrontes</a><br />
Sliced Fruit (oranges, lemons, limes)<br />
1/2 can Frozen Orange Juice Concentrate<br />
1/2 bottle Tropical Fruit Sparking Water</p>
<p>Mix together and serve over ice.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>So here&#8217;s the story of today&#8217;s Hump Day Happy Hour&#8230;my husband and I have some friends that were getting married and wanted to have a signature drink at their wedding.  After the decision was made on which drink they would be having, the next thing that needed to be decided was the name.  Their last name is Powell.  So for the majority of the wedding guests this drink was called the Powelltini, but for the close-knit-friend-crew we started calling these the Powell Panty Droppers because they just go down like water, like pink lemonade, like BUTTUH! And because they can get you in trouble because of said BUTTAH-like qualities.  Go forth, but beware&#8230;</p>
<p>1 part Citron Vodka<br />
1 part frozen lemonade<br />
1 part water<br />
Splash of Chambord</p>

I&#8217;ve got just what the doctor ordered&#8230; a Cranberry Mimosa! I make these for my family gathering every Thanksgiving and let me tell you&#8230; there sure are not any leftovers to take home!</p>

Next, dump in 2 bottles of your favorite bubbly(I use $5 <a href="http://www.bevmo.com/Shop/ProductDetail.aspx?utm_source=froogle&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=froogle&amp;ProductID=2066">Andres</a> and it tastes amazing) and stir.
