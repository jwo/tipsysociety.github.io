		<description><![CDATA[<p>With so many holiday events coming up, I need some soft, shiny and manageable hair. Since having my bambino, I&#8217;m not sure what the dealio is but my skin and hair are as dry as the Sahara dessert. <a href="http://www.shugahaircare.com/products.php">Shuga</a> aerosol leave in conditioner is my new favorite hair product. I used this before when I was participating in a bleach blonde look that left my hair straw-like and thirsty. So, I knew exactly what to turn to when I was in need this time.  My favorite part of this product is how multi functional it is. Spray it on pre- blowdry,  pre- flat iron or post styling to cure winter static.  Plus, it&#8217;s super light and won&#8217;t weigh the finest hair down and smells like shuga&#8217; cookies too.</p>
