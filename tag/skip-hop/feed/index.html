		<description><![CDATA[<p>Have you heard of this changing pad?  Dude, it&#8217;s SO THE BOMB!  It&#8217;s called a <a href="http://patemm.com/">Patemm Pad</a> and its round.  It folds up, it holds diapers, it holds wipes, it has a carrying handle so you can grab it and run out the door and you have everything you need for a quick trip.  It also fits perfectly in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000YDZEEA/?tag=weea-20">Skip Hop Duo Deluxe</a> diaper bag.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m telling you this changing pad will change your life.  I have this thing about public restrooms&#8230;.you know like they are just feces infested germ caves..nothing major.  So when I have to change my child, the same child that squirms relentlessly during diaper changes, I&#8217;m always a little freaked about doing it in public because I just know his poor delicate baby skin might touch filth.  Well not with this changing pad I tell you!  You can just unfold it and part of the circle protects your kiddo from the evil backside of the flip out changing table and the other part of the circle is underneath.  PERFECT!  Now if I could just get that other kid to stop sneezing in our direction&#8211;pardon the glare I&#8217;m giving you as I shield my child, while cleaning my hands with Purell.</p>
<h4>Patemm Promotions!</h4>
