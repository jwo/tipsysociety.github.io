		<description><![CDATA[<p>Last year was the first year I really made New Year&#8217;s <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2009/12/new-years-resolutions-ak-edition/">resolutions</a>.  I think I was a bit too ambitious with some of my list.  I did plow through several of them, but a couple just were not feasible.  I definitely got my closet organized, the extra bedroom closet organized and the junk drawer organized.  I got in more date nights with my hubby and made a ton of those movie nights as well!  I started off the year reading a lot more but ended the year with not reading again.</p>
<p>So this year I&#8217;ve decided to shorten my list and have everything be 100% attainable.  Here goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>After having a baby in May, definitely get back into my twice a week gym routine, no matter what. (shoes <a href="http://www.zappos.com/product/7680038/color/250315">here</a>.)</li>
<li>Take more pictures.  We took a ton of pictures of my son his first year and at a certain point that sorta dropped off.  I want to have these memories and I definitely want the new baby to have all of his baby pictures to look at when he&#8217;s older as well. (Does anyone have one of these &#8220;best of both worlds&#8221; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003MPOLX2/?tag=weea-20">cameras</a>? yay or nay?)</li>
<li>Get craftier.  I still want to do the baby clothes quilt of my son&#8217;s first year.  I would love to <a href="http://www.purlbee.com/the-purl-bee/2010/12/5/purl-soho-kits-super-easy-baby-blankets-are-back-plus-5-new.html">crochet a blanket</a>. I would also love to start doing more crafty projects with my son, especially for Christmas!  If I get one of these accomplished this year I will count that as a success!</li>
<li>Keep <a href="http://www.containerstore.com/shop?productId=10023938&amp;N=&amp;Ntt=drawer">organized</a> along the way.  We just cleaned out the extra bedroom to make room for baby #2 and it was super simple because we had organized it last year.  I want to continue to keep things organized so that I don&#8217;t have to take time to overhaul things because it&#8217;s gotten so bad.</li>
</ol>
<p>So there you have it, much shorter but I think definitely attainable!</p>
