		<description><![CDATA[<p>I have found the holy grail of secrets to luscious, shiny hair that lasts 6- 8 weeks. It is Paul Mitchell&#8217;s PM Shines. PM Shines are developed with an  intense hydrating complex (IHC) that soaks deep into the hair shaft  to add intense hydration and help replenish amino acids lost during the coloring process<strong>. </strong>They are applied like an all over hair color and shampooed out in about 20 mins. You can choose from clear or one of 32 intermixable colors. Your hair will never have been more shiny and manageable, I promise.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the key to my secret: I head over to my local Paul Mitchell School (<a href="http://paulmitchell.edu/search/locations">see other national locations here</a>) in Houston and pay a measly $25 for a colored shine and it&#8217;s $8 for the clear one.  I mean, look at all that shine right there. It&#8217;s almost blinding, isnt it? I kid. But it is really super shiny. And though you may hesitate about a &#8220;student&#8221; working on your hair, I assure you there is seriously no way to mess this up. It&#8217;s worked in like a box color or like a shampoo&#8230; it&#8217;s in no way some sort of rocket science. So, there we have it. My cat&#8217;s out of the bag. Go forth and seek shiny, beautiful hair ladies, for cheap.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been having a bad hair summer. It&#8217;s been ferociously hot and humid here&#8230;more so than years past. And I have wavy, coarse hair, and of course I try and straighten it and it just frizzes right out when I walk outside.  It&#8217;s much happier in the winter.</p>
<p>So I decided to change up my hair products to see what I can do and here is what I&#8217;m working with now:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://shop.avon.com/shop/product.aspx?code=&amp;level1_id=300&amp;level2_id=341&amp;pdept_id=682&amp;pf_id=39549&amp;level=3">Avon Lotus Shield</a>-Sarah over at <a href="http://www.hairthursday.com/?p=4360">Hair Thursday</a> introduced me to this and <a href="http://twitter.com/AWo/status/21703433089">this</a> is what I had to say about it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GZBWHO/?tag=weea-20">Osis Flattening Liquid</a>-The lady that cuts my hair introduced this to me. I had been using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BX5FS8/?tag=weea-20">Chi Straight Guard</a> and felt like it was weighing my hair down a bit much. She told me that I needed different products in different weather.  This flattening liquid is like a very lightweight gel as opposed to a creme.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.paulmitchell.com/PRODUCTS/PAULMITCHELL/EXPRESSSTYLE/Pages/HotOffThePress.aspx">Paul Mitchell Hot Off the Press</a>-I alternate between this and some other thermal guard sprays before I straighten my hair and this one seems to be working at the moment.</li>
</ol>
