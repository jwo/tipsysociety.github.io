They come in any color too. A neon yellow version of these made their way into my Halloween costume two years ago (80&#8217;s aerobic instructor).</li>
<li>AK-<a href="http://www.pasquals.com/tshirts.html">Cafe Pasqual T-Shirt</a>-I have this t-shirt from Cafe Pasquals in Santa Fe, NM and I swear to you that it is the most comfortable t-shirt I own.  It is just big enough to be loungey but not overly sloppy and it is SO SOFT.  I have no idea why this t-shirt is my favorite t-shirt in the world, but it is definitely my go-to loungewear at home.  And it&#8217;s SOFT.  Did I mention how SOFT it is? It also reminds me that I must go back at some point for more Huevos Rancheros.  If you haven&#8217;t been to Cafe Pasquals in Santa Fe, NM for breakfast, you simply must.</li>
<li>Sarah-<a href="http://athleta.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=46800&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=756360&amp;scid=756360062">Reversible Flipside Pant</a>-Love, love these yoga pants and I wear them around the house almost daily&#8230;it&#8217;s hard to find lounge pants when you&#8217;re tall b/c they all end up being cropped pants. They&#8217;re soft, comfy, come in Tall sizes, AND seem to go on clearance a lot!</li>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>So me and my Tipsy Girl <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/court/" target="_blank">Court</a> have been on a work out kick for the past 8 or 9 weeks. We joined our local <a href="http://www.ymca.net/" target="_blank">YMCA</a> and have been doing everything from spinning to boot camp, to basic cardio and weights. The main thing that we&#8217;ve taken away from our workouts is a) it&#8217;s nice to have a friend that keeps you honest and makes you go to workout, even when you don&#8217;t want to and b) the Y has given us an outlet for our ADD selves so we don&#8217;t get bored.</p>
<p><a href="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sk-workout-clothes.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2895" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sk-workout-clothes.png" alt="" width="500" height="495" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sk-workout-clothes.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sk-workout-clothes-150x150.png 150w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sk-workout-clothes-300x297.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>These are some of my workout basics:</p>

<li>Nike, <a href="http://niketown.nike.com/niketown/catalog/category.jsp?l=shop,pwp,c-1+100701/f-+10001+12001/hf-/t-ONESTORE/pn-1/ipp-48" target="_blank">Shox Turbo</a>: I&#8217;m a huge fan of this shoe. I got my first pair of shox two years ago and I think those need to be replaced with these awesome green ones!</li>
<li>Academy, <a href="http://www.academy.com/index.php?page=content&amp;target=products/apparel/womens/athletic/tanks&amp;start=0&amp;selectedSKU=WEB+0704-01681-0197" target="_blank">Soffe Cotton Rib Tank</a>: These are $6.99, need I say more?</li>

These are great (only if I have to) workout pants because they are not tight (I&#8217;m a bit booty girl and those cute yoga tights do nothing for me).</li>
<li>Academy, <a href="http://www.academy.com/index.php?page=content&amp;target=products/apparel/womens/athletic/shorts&amp;start=16&amp;selectedSKU=WEB+0707-02080-1646" target="_blank">Nike Tempo Shorts</a>: You know that embarrassing sweaty ass mark, aka SWASS, (I&#8217;m just being honest) you get when you&#8217;re really working hard? These shorts DO NOT show that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 🙂</li>
<li>Academy, <a href="http://www.academy.com/index.php?page=content&amp;target=products/apparel/womens/athletic/tops&amp;start=8&amp;selectedSKU=WEB+0701-02080-6097" target="_blank">Nike Dri-Fit T-shirt</a>: Similar to the shorts, this shirt doesn&#8217;t show sweat marks so people can go on believing that us girls don&#8217;t sweat like pigs&#8230;OH, and this shirt keeps you nice and toasty when the weather is less than optimal outside.</li>
