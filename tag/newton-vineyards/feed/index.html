		<description><![CDATA[<p>For this Winery Spotlight I wanted to talk about my FAVORITE stop during our honeymoon wine country tour (circa 2007): <a href="http://www.newtonvineyard.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">Newton Vineyards</a> in St. Helena, CA.</p>
<p>Reasons I loved this winery:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #993366"><strong>AMAZING Landscaping</strong></span>: To be able to say the landscaping was amazing in a place as beautiful as Napa Valley is something really special, but this place definitely stood out. All of the gardens in the vineyard are Asian inspired and meticulously maintained.</li>
<li><span style="color: #993366"><strong>WONDERFUL People</strong></span>: We ended up wine tasting with our chauffeur on a day that Newton Vineyards wasn&#8217;t open to the public; however, due to some miscommunication, we ended up at Newton and the wonderful people went ahead and gave us a complimentary tasting that included the drop-kick-me-in-the-face BEST Chardonnay I&#8217;ve ever had; <a href="http://www.newtonvineyard.com/category.aspx?categoryID=689" target="_blank">Unfiltered Chardonnay</a>. (Kinda pricey though, retailing at about $50.00/bottle.)</li>
<li><span style="color: #993366"><strong>GREAT Tips</strong></span>: The lady that lead our tasting was so well educated and full of knowledge that it was a tad overwhelming to take it all in, but the one thing I will never forget is the way she taught us to &#8220;cleanse our pallet&#8221;, which, in wine tasting terms, is extremely important as you try different varieties of wines. <strong>To cleanse your pallet, simply smell a plain white paper napkin for several seconds</strong>. I don&#8217;t remember how or why this worked, but it did!</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to tell you to run out and buy these wines UNLESS a) you are a wine connoisseur and have never tried Newton or b) filthy rich and could care less if you drop some serious coin on vino; however, if you do run out and buy any of the Newton wines, I promise you <span style="text-decoration: line-through">won&#8217;t </span>shouldn&#8217;t be disappointed because they&#8217;re all amazing.</p>
<p>If you are planning a vaca to Napa Valley, make sure to include Newton Vineyards as one of your stops&#8230;and invite me of course!!!!</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366"><strong>Final Question</strong></span>: 3 of the 5 pictures above were taken with my camera&#8230;can you tell which ones they are???????</p>
