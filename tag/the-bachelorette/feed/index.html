		<description><![CDATA[<p>So last night was the finale of <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/the-bachelorette/index">The Bachelorette</a>. In the past, <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/07/guilty-pleasures/">Sarah has talked about the trash tv she watches</a>, so I&#8217;m gonna go ahead and throw out there that yes, I watch The Bachelorette, <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/the-bachelor">The Bachelor</a> and it looks like I&#8217;m also going to be watching <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/bachelor-pad">Bachelor Pad</a> for whatever reason.  I think ABC has some sort of brainwashing capabilities, because my TiVo just keeps on recording&#8230;</p>
<p>I thought the finale last night was actually pretty good, I kinda liked how everything went down. I also thought that Frank could not have looked more like a poon than he did for leaving when he did, but GUESS WHAT, yep, more poon-like last night by being a no-show for the After the Final Rose.</p>
<p>So what do you think? Did she pick right? Will it last? Did you cry like a little baby at the rainbow like I did?</p>
