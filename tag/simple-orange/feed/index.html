		<description><![CDATA[<p>We have our first The Tipsy Wedding Project update for you!!  We begin in pure Tipsy fashion with the drink that Christen chose.  If you&#8217;ll <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/05/hump-day-happy-hour-meets-the-tipsy-wedding-project/">recall</a> we gave our suggestions and then asked for yours.</p>
<p>Christen and Ed picked a madras to serve to their guests and decided to name it after one of the ideas our commenters threw at them, the &#8220;Fall in Love&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Madras</strong><br />
1 oz orange juice<br />
1.5 oz vodka<br />
3 oz cranberry<br />
garnish with an orange slice!</p>
<p>(served on the rocks in a cocktail glass)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the backstory Christen gave us on the drink decision:</p>
<blockquote><p>We started playing around with some of the recipes provided by you Tipsy gals, which was really fun, as you can imagine!  We&#8217;d mix up ingredients and try different combos, but never really hit on a clear choice.  Then I rememered how much I like the madras.  So I mixed one up for me, one for Ed and he agreed it was tasty!  We didn&#8217;t want something too girly-pink or too hardcore (like a martini) and this was a good medium.  The color was fun, we could easily garnish with an orange slice, and it was easy enough for the bartender to make in batches and serve up.  Winner!</p></blockquote>
