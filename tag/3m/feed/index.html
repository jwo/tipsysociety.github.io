		<description><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m in the midst of a complete closet overhaul.  I have a lot of stuff to get rid of and I also have a lot of things I want to reorganize.  I&#8217;ve been searching pinterest and googling tips and organization tools to get my closet all spiffed up.  One of the ideas I ran across was to use a regular old bath robe or bath towel hook for your belts.  So I headed to my neighborhood Target and instead of getting the regular bath/towel hook I had planned on, I ran across <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000M3THK4/?tag=weea-20">these</a> and thought it might be even better.  So far so good! There were different sizes that will hold different weights.  If you decide to go this route you might want to take into account that you can&#8217;t hang a tiny belt on the wide hook, so you might want to get different sizes for different belts, but man otherwise, this is getting my organizational juices going!</p>
