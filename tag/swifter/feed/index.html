		<description><![CDATA[<p>So, it&#8217;s no secret to those who know me that I&#8217;m a clean FREAK!!! (Seriously, I sometimes have anxiety about it.) Here are my top cleaning products of the moment.</p>
<p><a href="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/sk-cleaning-supplies.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2009" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/sk-cleaning-supplies.png" alt="sk-cleaning supplies" width="500" height="350" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/sk-cleaning-supplies.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/sk-cleaning-supplies-300x210.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0010B5EQS/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Clorox Toilet Wand</a>, Amazon: No more icky toilet brushes sitting in your bathroom. Once you&#8217;re finished cleaning the bowl, simply flush it!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FSZNZY/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Clorox Anywhere Hard Surface</a>, Amazon: I use this for almost everything. Any little spill or splatter out comes the Clorox spray.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0012B2WMK/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Sprayway Glass Cleaner</a>, Amazon: The BEST glass cleaner ever. I have seriously gone from store to store before looking for this stuff. Luckily, Wal-Mart usually has it.  This glass cleaner never leaves streaks!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000ZMY2ZC/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Goo Gone</a>, Amazon: This is a recent love of mine and I&#8217;ll tell you why. I had the interior of my house re-painted in September and, much to my dismay, the painters accidentally got paint on my CARPET! So, after I discovered this I called my painters to, of course, complain and they told me not to do anything to it. The next morning they came over with Goo Gone and got it out in less than a minute: no stain, no wet spot, no smear, no nothing. So I went out and bought me some of this miracle product and have successfully used it over and over again to get hard-to-clean gunk or mud or smudge off of almost everything.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.target.com/Dirt-Devil-KURV-Hand-Vac/dp/B000U8LCPO/ref=br_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;frombrowse=1&amp;searchView=grid5&amp;searchNodeID=12957271&amp;node=12957271&amp;searchRank=salesrank&amp;searchPage=1&amp;searchSize=30&amp;id=Dirt%20Devil%20KURV%20Hand%20Vac" target="_blank">Dirt Devil KURV Hand Vac</a>, Target: Just a handy little gadget to have around so you don&#8217;t always have to lug out the big vac&#8230;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001TQ8HZO/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Scrubbing Bubbles</a>, Amazon: Standard bathroom cleaner, not too many miracles, other than it just melts the dirt away!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006ZUHVG/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Swifter Max</a>, Amazon: I honestly believe that since the Swifter Max is double the size of the regular Swifter, I get finished mopping soooo much faster&#8230;this has not been proven, but I think it makes sense&#8230;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VKQQM0/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Cascade 2 in 1 Action Packs</a>, Amazon: Another time saver&#8230;no more putting Jet Dry or any other rinsing agent in your dishwasher!</li>
</ol>
<p>***Any of these products can be purchased at  your ordinary grocery or cleaning store.</p>
