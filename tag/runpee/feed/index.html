		<description><![CDATA[<p>I knew something like this existed but I hadn&#8217;t ever really needed this app before.  But as we know, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/AWo/status/4647992262922240">I do now</a>. This past weekend I went with a bunch of the ladies in my family to see Burlesque and I went ahead and downloaded this app so that I would know when it would be a good time to <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/runpee-by-rock-software/id320589326?mt=8">RunPee</a>.  The great thing about this app is that it has push notifications, so you start a timer when the movie starts and it&#8217;ll notify you when you can go. Or you can read the description that tells you when in the movie to go and GO NOW. It&#8217;s fabulous!  Highly recommend!</p>
