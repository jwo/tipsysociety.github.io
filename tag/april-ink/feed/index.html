		<description><![CDATA[<p>Recently a friend of mine who is the mom to a 10-week-old baby girl told me she was approached at her pediatrician&#8217;s office by another mother regarding a play group and she handed her a calling card.  My friend had never heard of a &#8220;mom&#8221; calling card before.  I had gotten some a while back for myself as I&#8217;m the proud mama to a 14-month-old <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">tackling shrieking speed demon</span> bouncing baby boy myself.  I bet you can guess what are on mine&#8230;if you guessed OWLS you are the big winner of the day!</p>
<p>Anyway, so since it had been a while since I was on the hunt for a calling card I decided to peruse Etsy to see what the great handmade peeps were offering now.  I fell in love with all of these from <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/aprilink?section_id=5602945">April Ink</a>.  I love April Ink&#8217;s selection, colors, how modern they are&#8230;.everything!  And you know, you don&#8217;t have to be a mom to get a calling card&#8230;they are great for bloggers, etsy store owners, nannies, the list could go on and on.</p>
