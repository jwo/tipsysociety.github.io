		<description><![CDATA[<p>Soooooo, an introductory, I have been working on my <a title="Couch to 5k" href="http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml" target="_blank">C25K</a> thing.  I got turned on to this program from an older post over at <a title="Whoorl" href="http://whoorl.com/archives/435" target="_blank">Whoorl</a>.  Apparently it is/was this thing that helps you go from not.running.an.inch to be being able to run a 5k or even more.  I think I missed the boat when it was a HUGE DEAL, but am loving it nonetheless.  Melis and I actually have signed up for a 5k coming up here soon because of our excitement with the program.</p>
<p>Back to where I was headed&#8230;.Aus comes home with a funrun sign up sheet.  &#8220;Mommy will you run with me&#8221;.  Me:  HELLZ yes.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6048" title="cr-fun run" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/cr-fun-run.png" alt="" width="500" height="335" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/cr-fun-run.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/cr-fun-run-300x201.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>A couple of things noteworthy about said &#8220;funrun&#8221;:</p>
<p>1.  Parents took the fun out of funrun &#8211; they were there for blood.  I ran the entire time (a whopping mile), didn&#8217;t die and had a decent time.  There were parents there ready to be beat the shit out of me to get to the finish line.  Not something I was prepared for.</p>
<p>2.  Kids took the run out of funrun &#8211; shouldn&#8217;t funrun mean you at least attempt to run?  Apparently not.  I don&#8217;t think any elaboration is needed on that one.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we had a great time, Ben was a really good cheerleader (HAHA) and it was good mommy/son bonding.</p>
<p>Sidenote: thats Aus&#8217; runners face!</p>
