		<description><![CDATA[<p>I think I&#8217;ve said on here before that my husband is the main cook of the family.  I know, I totally nailed it on picking the right one!  So he does the day to day cooking and I do what I like to call &#8220;party&#8221; cooking.  Today I&#8217;m going to share with you a recipe that has secured a spot on our weekly menu and I get PUMPED about it because it&#8217;s THAT good.  This recipe is a modified version of a Rick Bayless recipe, the rice is a not-so-secret-anymore-hubby recipe.</p>
<p>Chipotle Shrimp &amp; Rice<br />
1/4 cup butter<br />
2 cloves minced garlic<br />
1/4 cup red wine<br />
1 1/2 tbsp worcestershire<br />
2 tbsp chipotle peppers in adobo sauce<br />
1 lb shrimp</p>
<p>Melt butter. Saute garlic for 30 seconds.  Add remainder of ingredients.  Add shrimp and cook for 5 minutes. Fold rice in&#8230;see below for rice recipe.</p>
<p>Rice (seriously best.rice.ever. it&#8217;s a ricegasm)<br />
1 tbsp olive oil<br />
1 tbsp butter<br />
1/2 chopped onion<br />
1 tsp minced garlic (or that little jar of roasted garlic sooooo easy)<br />
1 tsp salt<br />
1 cup rice<br />
2 cups chicken broth</p>
<p>Heat pan on medium heat and and add olive oil and butter.  Add chopped onion, stir and let sit for a minute. Add minced garlic and heat until onion is soft. Add rice and stir to coat the rice. Heat until rice turns a slight<br />
brownish color. Add salt and chicken broth. Increase heat to boil, turn heat down to low. Heat on low for 14 minutes, stir.</p>
