		<description><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve heard the old school saying, &#8220;A woman&#8217;s hair is her crowning glory.&#8221; HAHAHAHA&#8230;I&#8217;m not saying that&#8217;s a fact, but I do know that almost all women have their favorite hair &#8220;stuff&#8221;, be it a product or an accessory.</p>
<p>Here are our favs, what are yours?</p>
<ol>
<li>AK, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00284W03Q/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Scunci No-slip Grip Flat Headwraps</a>: I don&#8217;t generally wear hair accessories and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m devoted to a product as much as Melis is but I do have one hair item that I wear without a doubt during all my workouts and it&#8217;s this no slip grip headband. I can&#8217;t stand to have hair in my eyes when I&#8217;m working out and these babies definitely do the trick and stay put!</li>
<li>Melis, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001235I24/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Biolage by Matrix Hydro-Foaming Styler</a>: I use hair mouse EVERY SINGLE DAY. If I don&#8217;t, my hair sticks to my head and I look bald. Trust me, It&#8217;s not a pretty sight. I can&#8217;t even put my hair in a ponytail without mouse, its that bad. I have used many different volumizing mouses in my life, and this is by far my favorite. It gives a lot of volume but it doesn&#8217;t make my hair stiff. Not to mention it smells A-mazing.</li>
<li>Sarah, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NEPX3E/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Goody Ouchless Elastics</a>: I&#8217;m a ponytail girl true and through&#8230;they&#8217;re easy, fast, can be cute, and it gives me an alternative to washing and styling my hair every single day! These are my go-to pony tail holders because they&#8217;re big enough to hold my massive amounts of hair without damaging it.</li>
<li>Court, <a href="http://www.johnfrieda.com/products/product_detail.asp?productLine=frizz_ease&amp;productCategory=8&amp;pid=52" target="_blank">Frizz-Ease Hair Serum</a>: This is the OG of products for me, but its stayed an ol&#8217; faithful for me. I always have a three step process for my curls that begins with a serum and this legend always makes its way in the mix.</li>

<p>John Freida pretty much invented products for trying to tame our beasts, but these latest few products leave my mop lookin&#8217; real nice! Â Soft, but not frizzy. Â Defined, but not crunchy.</p>
<p>Here they are in order of when I use them&#8230;</p>

<p>The best thing about this line is the price tag. Â All four can be purchased for a total of aroundÂ <strong><em>20 dollars</em></strong> at your local CVS,Â Walgreen&#8217;s, or grocery store.</p>
