		<description><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve heard the old school saying, &#8220;A woman&#8217;s hair is her crowning glory.&#8221; HAHAHAHA&#8230;I&#8217;m not saying that&#8217;s a fact, but I do know that almost all women have their favorite hair &#8220;stuff&#8221;, be it a product or an accessory.</p>
<p>Here are our favs, what are yours?</p>
<ol>
<li>AK, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00284W03Q/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Scunci No-slip Grip Flat Headwraps</a>: I don&#8217;t generally wear hair accessories and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m devoted to a product as much as Melis is but I do have one hair item that I wear without a doubt during all my workouts and it&#8217;s this no slip grip headband. I can&#8217;t stand to have hair in my eyes when I&#8217;m working out and these babies definitely do the trick and stay put!</li>
<li>Melis, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001235I24/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Biolage by Matrix Hydro-Foaming Styler</a>: I use hair mouse EVERY SINGLE DAY. If I don&#8217;t, my hair sticks to my head and I look bald. Trust me, It&#8217;s not a pretty sight. I can&#8217;t even put my hair in a ponytail without mouse, its that bad. I have used many different volumizing mouses in my life, and this is by far my favorite. It gives a lot of volume but it doesn&#8217;t make my hair stiff. Not to mention it smells A-mazing.</li>
<li>Sarah, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NEPX3E/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Goody Ouchless Elastics</a>: I&#8217;m a ponytail girl true and through&#8230;they&#8217;re easy, fast, can be cute, and it gives me an alternative to washing and styling my hair every single day! These are my go-to pony tail holders because they&#8217;re big enough to hold my massive amounts of hair without damaging it.</li>
<li>Court, <a href="http://www.johnfrieda.com/products/product_detail.asp?productLine=frizz_ease&amp;productCategory=8&amp;pid=52" target="_blank">Frizz-Ease Hair Serum</a>: This is the OG of products for me, but its stayed an ol&#8217; faithful for me. I always have a three step process for my curls that begins with a serum and this legend always makes its way in the mix.</li>

<p>Call it what you will (<a title="Poodle head" href="http://www.canen.me.uk/poodles/images/christopher_robin.jpg" target="_blank">Poodle head</a>,  <a title="Shirley Temple" href="http://cinemoviehistory.com/user/cimage/ShirleyTemple.jpg" target="_blank">Shirley Temple</a>, <a title="Curly Fry" href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3510/3273016248_1f374a6b70.jpg" target="_blank">Curly Fry</a>, <a title="Krusty the Clown" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5a/Krustytheclown.png" target="_blank">Krusty</a> <a title="Lion's Head" href="http://www.aesop-fable.com/wp-content/uploads/lion-head-bw-300x297.jpg" target="_blank">Lion Head</a>, <a title="Carrot Top" href="http://imeanwhat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/carrot-top.jpg" target="_blank">Carrot Top</a>, <a title="Side-show Bob" href="http://animatedtv.about.com/library/graphics/sideshowbob.jpg" target="_blank">Side-show Bob</a>, <a title="Medusa" href="http://www.arnoldbocklin.com/images/Medusa.jpg" target="_blank">Medusa</a>, <a title="Nappy Headed Monster" href="http://images.ibsys.com/2007/0405/11536557_320X240.jpg" target="_blank">Nappyheaded Monster</a>), curly hair is certainly a gift to embrace.  Don&#8217;t deny it&#8211;if you do, it&#8217;ll bite back.</p>
<p>I generally have to rotate through a combination of products/brands to get my hair in the condition I need, but recently I started trying an entire  <a title="John Frieda Hair Line" href="http://www.johnfrieda.com/" target="_blank">line</a> that I am completely diggin&#8217;.</p>
<p>John Freida pretty much invented products for trying to tame our beasts, but these latest few products leave my mop lookin&#8217; real nice!  Soft, but not frizzy.  Defined, but not crunchy.</p>
<p>Here they are in order of when I use them&#8230;</p>
<ol>
<li> <a title="Shampoo" href="http://www.johnfrieda.com/products/product_detail.asp?productLine=frizz_ease&amp;pid=86" target="_blank">FRIZZ-EASE Curl Around Style Starting Daily Shampoo</a></li>
<li> <a title="Conditioner" href="http://www.johnfrieda.com/products/product_detail.asp?productLine=frizz_ease&amp;pid=88" target="_blank">FRIZZ-EASE Curl Around Style Starting Daily Conditioner</a></li>
<li><a title="Gel" href="http://www.johnfrieda.com/products/product_detail.asp?productLine=frizz_ease&amp;pid=58" target="_blank">FRIZZ-EASE Curl Clearly Defined Style Holding Gel</a></li>
<li><a title="Spray" href="http://www.johnfrieda.com/products/product_detail.asp?productLine=frizz_ease&amp;pid=60" target="_blank">FRIZZ EASE Dream Curls Curl Perfecting Spray</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The best thing about this line is the price tag.  All four can be purchased for a total of around <strong><em>20 dollars</em></strong> at your local CVS, Walgreen&#8217;s, or grocery store.</p>
