		<description><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve talked many times on here about my love for all things Mexican including the decor in <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/02/tour-de-casa-ak/">my house</a>.  Today is All Saint&#8217;s Day and tomorrow is Day of the Dead in Mexico.  Basically, it&#8217;s a celebration to pray for and remember friends and relatives who have passed away. My anniversary falls in October, so when we would take our annual trips to Mexico for our anniversary we usually got to see the preparation for Day of the Dead and it was AWESOME.  The cemeteries would be brightly decorated and you would see tons of different items for sale with the Day of the Dead theme. I&#8217;ve got several skeleton figurines throughout the house and I&#8217;d LOVE this little mariachi set!</p>
