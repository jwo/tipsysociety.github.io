		<description><![CDATA[<p>And they hold my necklaces. Gotcha! Seriously though, using a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GPVDLE/?tag=weea-20">tie rack</a> as necklace storage might be the best idea I have ever had. Actually I stole it from my old roommate, so it wasn&#8217;t my idea at all. But it might be the best idea anyone has had. You can get a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GPVDLE/?tag=weea-20">tie rack</a> for around 5 bucks so there is no need to be wasting money on the expensive ones unless you are going for looks. (Obviously I was not if that picture is any indication). Just screw it into your closet wall and BAM! Cheap, easy storage.</p>
