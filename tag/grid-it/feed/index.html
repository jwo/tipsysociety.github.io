		<description><![CDATA[<p>Have you seen these before? I, myself, just stumbled upon them&#8230;of course this was AFTER our last little trip out of town where we have every type of technological device crammed where we can fit it.  You can get one of these <a href="http://www.cocooninnovations.com/cat_info.php?cat_id=61">Grid-Its</a>! in any size you need and strap your phone, charger, etc etc down with all these little grippy bands.  They remind me of those headbands you use for working out..you know what I&#8217;m talking about ladies!</p>
<p>But anyway, man, the possibilities for these&#8230; For me, I definitely think this would be helpful when you are lugging the kiddo stuff like a sound machine, monitor, camera, maybe an iPad or small DVD player?  I mean wow, to have all that stuff in one location, organized!! I love me some organization!</p>
<p>Has anybody tried these before? Do they work well?</p>
