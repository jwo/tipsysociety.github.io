I&#8217;m probably super late to this party but I was using a Revlon cheapo eyelash curler for years and at least for me it didn&#8217;t do much. I would see all over the place, CURL YOUR LASHES as part of your quick 5 minute makeup routine and I would think, man that doesn&#8217;t do anything for me. WELL. I decided to try out this one by Tarte and IT&#8217;S THE BOMB! It literally curls SO MUCH I can&#8217;t BELIZE it! It&#8217;s worth the cost, plus this one that I bought came with a little sample size mascara and I&#8217;m never one to turn down trying a new mascara.</p>
