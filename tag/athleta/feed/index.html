		<description><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m lucky enough to have a fantastic job that I love AND I get to work from home! Working from home means, I rarely wear makeup (unless I have a lunch date w/ one of my fabulous Tipsy gals or co-workers) and I rarely wear anything other than lounge wear.</p>
<p>Luckily, me being preggo has not effected this part of my wardrobe because I can still wear ALL of my pre-pregnancy faves (at least as far as the pants go)! Here are some of the staples of my &#8220;working from home&#8221; wardrobe:</p>

They come in any color too. A neon yellow version of these made their way into my Halloween costume two years ago (80&#8217;s aerobic instructor).</li>
<li>AK-<a href="http://www.pasquals.com/tshirts.html">Cafe Pasqual T-Shirt</a>-I have this t-shirt from Cafe Pasquals in Santa Fe, NM and I swear to you that it is the most comfortable t-shirt I own.  It is just big enough to be loungey but not overly sloppy and it is SO SOFT.  I have no idea why this t-shirt is my favorite t-shirt in the world, but it is definitely my go-to loungewear at home.  And it&#8217;s SOFT.  Did I mention how SOFT it is? It also reminds me that I must go back at some point for more Huevos Rancheros.  If you haven&#8217;t been to Cafe Pasquals in Santa Fe, NM for breakfast, you simply must.</li>
<li>Sarah-<a href="http://athleta.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=46800&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=756360&amp;scid=756360062">Reversible Flipside Pant</a>-Love, love these yoga pants and I wear them around the house almost daily&#8230;it&#8217;s hard to find lounge pants when you&#8217;re tall b/c they all end up being cropped pants. They&#8217;re soft, comfy, come in Tall sizes, AND seem to go on clearance a lot!</li>
