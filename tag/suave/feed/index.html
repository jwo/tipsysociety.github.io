		<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.suave.com/Dry-Shampoo-Spray">Suave Professionals Dry Shampoo</a> is a new product and looked interesting, so I bought it. I tried it on my grease ball second day hair and ran screaming into my guest room to tell Melis: IT WORKS! IT SMELLS GREAT (much much better than Treseme)! IT&#8217;S $3! We had thought it was too good to be true, but no. And you would think I would have more cool things going on than to be super pumped about a hair product, but also no.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>On our wedding night we stayed at a cute little Houston boutique hotel. And while your wedding night is special in so many ways, I fondly look upon that night and that hotel for the toiletry products that were available to me. Oh, the clean, invigorating feeling these products left me with after a long night of dancing and nervous sweating! I was in heaven, I tell ya. Well, Aveda was the maker of these wonderous Rosemary Mint products, but imagine my surprise when I see a budget friendly version at my local Wally World. I&#8217;m 100% smitten.</p>
