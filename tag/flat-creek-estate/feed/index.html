		<description><![CDATA[<p>I love wine, I love wineries, I love wine tasting. SO, in the honor of all these loves, I&#8217;m going to start &#8220;spotlighting&#8221; wineries that I love and that you <span style="text-decoration: line-through">will</span> should visit.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flatcreekestate.com/index.html" target="_blank">Flat Creek Estate</a> is an award-winning winery located in Marble Falls, TX, which is just a hop, skip, and a jump from the fabulous/trendy Austin, TX. Their wines are awesome, moderately priced, and the views are AMAZING!</p>
<p>Here are a few of my favorite from that can be <a href="http://www.flatcreekestate.com/wines.html" target="_blank">purchased</a> from Flat Creek Estate:</p>
<p><a href="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/sk-winery-1b.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2371" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/sk-winery-1b.png" alt="" width="500" height="486" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/sk-winery-1b.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/sk-winery-1b-300x291.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>

<li>Super Texan: This is a red wine that is really smooth. I like to think of it as &#8220;a red wine on training wheels.&#8221; I&#8217;m not a regular drinker of red; however, I do make exceptions or this particular one.</li>
<li>Sparkling Almond: This is a sparkling white wine (basically a champagne) that is sweet and nutty. You can literally smell a faint hint of almonds when you open the bottle.  If you&#8217;re looking to impress your friends on a special occasion, I would suggest purchasing a bottle of this.</li>
<li>Pinot Grigio: BEST PG (pinot grigio) ever&#8230;and I&#8217;m not exaggerating&#8230;ok, I might be exaggerating a little, but it is very good&#8230;it&#8217;s on the dryer side, but with a fruity after taste. (After taste is &#8220;technically&#8221; referred to as the back of your palette, but I didn&#8217;t want to sound too fancy.)</li>
<li> Buckin Horse White: I have actually never tried this wine, but it was a gold medal winner at the 2009 Pacific Rim International Wine Competition and is sold for a semi-reasonable $17.95/bottle, which puts it at the top of my list the next time I place an order!</li>
</ol>
<p>Side Note I *** I am not a wine expert and I don&#8217;t try to be; however I really like trying and learning about wines. If you&#8217;ve never been to a winery, but enjoy the occasional glass, I would like to suggest that you try and visit a winery in your area soon. It&#8217;s a fun and inexpensive way to both learn and drink at the same time! Also, <span style="text-decoration: line-through">when</span> if you go, drag your hubby or boyfriend with you. Trust me, my hubby doesn&#8217;t EVER drink wine, but he LOVES the wineries and always has a great time. (Please keep in mind he&#8217;s a small town country boy that hates any and everything that city people may like, aka, wine.)</p>
<p>Side Note II *** My apologies for the INSANELY long post&#8230;happy Friday!</p>
