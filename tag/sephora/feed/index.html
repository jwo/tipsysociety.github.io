I&#8217;m probably super late to this party but I was using a Revlon cheapo eyelash curler for years and at least for me it didn&#8217;t do much. I would see all over the place, CURL YOUR LASHES as part of your quick 5 minute makeup routine and I would think, man that doesn&#8217;t do anything for me. WELL. I decided to try out this one by Tarte and IT&#8217;S THE BOMB! It literally curls SO MUCH I can&#8217;t BELIZE it! It&#8217;s worth the cost, plus this one that I bought came with a little sample size mascara and I&#8217;m never one to turn down trying a new mascara.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">First of all, do not get the impression from the title of this product that I&#8217;m an ALL NIGHTER type of girl unless by that you mean my kids are not sleeping and I&#8217;m up all night in that kind of way. But I can promise you I am not wearing makeup while my kids are trying to stay up all night and suck my will to live out of me.  I originally bought this to try and set my makeup so it stays longer DURING THE DAY. I really only have time to apply my makeup first thing in the morning, so if I have dinner plans that night I don&#8217;t have time to start all over if my makeup has just melted off throughout the day. This stuff is pretty great because I can do my makeup first thing in the morning and spray a few sprays when I&#8217;m done and it really does set it for the day.</p>

So I have been having a nail dilemma for a while now&#8230;I know that if I don&#8217;t go get manicures then I bite my nails. Time has been a problem for the last year in terms of getting manicures, so you can just imagine the state of my nails. I generally only have time to go get a manicure on a Saturday afternoon. Obviously sometimes that just doesn&#8217;t work out. So I need to get into some sort of new home routine that keeps everything looking somewhat nice so I don&#8217;t bite them. A LONG time ago I posted this <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2009/11/nail-emergency-a-mini-mani/">home mani</a>, and I can definitely get on that train again for sure.  I also bought these nail wipes (IMPULSE PURCHASE) recently that I think will help when the polish starts chipping and I can&#8217;t get back to the nail salon.<br />
<a href="http://www.sephora.com/bear-naked-nail-wipes-P376465">Josie Maran Bear Naked Nail Wipes</a></p>
<p>So tell me, what should I do in terms of base coat and top coat at home when I can&#8217;t get to the salon? And for those stay at home mamas when do you do your home nail care? Nap time? After the kiddos are in bed? When? HELP!</p>

Has anybody used this as a dry shampoo AND to cover greys? I just read that <a href="http://www.realstylenetwork.com/blogs/beauty/2013/01/jillian-harris-5-favourite-beauty-products/">Jillian Harris</a> of The Bachelorette fame uses it for that very reason and I think I could get on board with that to prolong my color. But would love to know if anybody else out there uses it and what they think&#8230;.<br />

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Y&#8217;all, my husband claims to NEVER read Tipsy. And if you knew him, you would believe it with all your heart. He is not too good with the technology. Let&#8217;s just say he has asked me not to send him emails with the &#8220;paperclips&#8221; on them because he doesn&#8217;t know how to open them. Well, this Christmas I found out he is a big fat liar. He visited my <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/12/christmas-wishlist-der-edition/">tipsy wishlist</a> and man did he deliver! Here is some of my loot:</p>
<ol>
<li>Amazon, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002JVWQSW/?tag=weea-20">Modern Family </a>&#8211; I just popped this in the other night and am trying to convert other family members. I know it won&#8217;t take long.</li>
<li>Amazon, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0036DI2XK/?tag=weea-20">Timi and Leslie Diaper Bag</a>&#8211; OMG so cute. The husband claimed to have fought a preggo in Neimans for the last bag in the store. My hero.</li>
<li>Amazon, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001VA8PWI/?tag=weea-20">Bare Minerals Starter Kit</a>&#8211; Holy shit balls. This is the best make up ever. I am a makeup junkie and have tried and used every thing out there. I swear to the beauty gods that I am converted for life.</li>
<li>Sephora, <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P273803&amp;categoryId=B70">Shimmer and Shine Collection</a>&#8211; This was just icing on the mineral cake! Sparkly shadows and the best lipgloss eva came in this baby.</li>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The Rodeo just ended here in Houston which generally means I would have been stuffing my piehole with sausage on a stick, mountains of curly fries, Goode Co. chicken sandwiches, maybe 1 or 4 funnel cakes.  Alas we did not make it out there, at least not in the sense that we normally do&#8230;we went to the petting zoo but that was about it.  So no food this year for me!  What&#8217;s better than Sausage on a Stick? Products on a Stick!!  Anybody tried any of these?</p>
