		<description><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s that time again! Christmas is sneaking up on us and we tipsy gals have been pretty damn good this year if I don&#8217;t say so myself. When I sent my letter to Santa, here is what was on it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Amazon, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002JVWQSW/?tag=weea-20">Modern Family Season 1</a>&#8211; I can&#8217;t sing this show&#8217;s praises enough and I totally want to own this so I can re-watch it over and over.</li>
<li>Nordstrom, <a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3037175?origin=keywordsearch&amp;resultback=300">Michael Kors Chronograph Watch</a>&#8211; I haven&#8217;t owned an actual watch of value since I couldn&#8217;t tell you when. And I know there are much more pricey pieces available, but since I&#8217;ve been out of the game for a some time&#8230; I&#8217;ll start off easy.</li>
<li>Express, <a href="http://www.express.com/essential-stretch-military-shirt-23572-721.pro?Mcatn=Shirts&amp;Mpper=3&amp;Mcatp=cat_2&amp;Mcat=721&amp;Mpos=1&amp;Mcatg=category_root&amp;Mpg=SEARCH%2BNAV&amp;Mcatpn=For+Her&amp;user_att_name=Interest&amp;user_att_value=Email&amp;Mrsaa=*&amp;Mrsavf=*&amp;Mppg=0#jsLink">Essential Stretch Military Shirt</a>&#8211; I am a HUGE fan of the military trend and the stretch in this top would allow room for the ladies if ya know what I mean.</li>

It&#8217;s such a unique keepsake that I would cherish forever.</li>
<li>Amazon, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0047R2EJC/?tag=weea-20">Hobo International Metallic Lauren Wallet</a> &#8211; I adore my hobo lauren wallet that I have, but it honestly has seen better days. I really like the metallic version for my upgrade.</li>
<li>Amazon, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003UWUC9E/?tag=weea-20">Raspberry Converse</a>&#8211; Since the purchase of my very first pair of converse, I am wanting to own every color of the rainbow and these are the perfect shade of pink.</li>

<li>Timi and Leslie, <a href="http://www.timiandleslie.com/products/baby-jane/">Baby Jane Bag</a>&#8211; I LOVE my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002VK0CKK/?tag=weea-20">current diaper bag</a> so much, but a gal can never have too many bags, right? I love the sleekness of this bag and I would totally rock this with or without my baby.</li>
<li>Gap, <a href="http://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=37455&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=788194">Plaid Flannel Pajamas</a>&#8211; I have always wanted a classic set of jammies to kick it in during the winter months.</li>
<li>Amazon, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001VA8PWI/?tag=weea-20">Bare Escentuals Starter Kit</a>&#8211; I have always wanted to give this stuff a go. I have never used any type of mineral make-up before, but those infomercials sure do sell me.</li>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Last week Susan at The Working Closet did a post entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/workingcloset/2010/10/13/five-things-i-never-leave-home-without/">5 Things I Never Leave Home Without</a>&#8220;.  These are things that no matter where she&#8217;s going she never leaves home without them.  So it got me thinking&#8230;what would that be for me?  Some of the things she had on her list were on my list but some were also different.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3020908?origin=PredictiveSearch&amp;resultback=100">Hobo International Lauren Wallet</a>-I think this is probably a given for most people but no matter what I am taking this with me because it houses a lot of the items below.  Mine isn&#8217;t yellow, it&#8217;s turquoise but alas I could not find that picture to show you.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/templates/products/spp/index.tmpl?CATEGORY_ID=CATEGORY22745&amp;PRODUCT_ID=PROD1112">Bobbi Brown Cosmetics Lip Color in Slopes</a>-I come from a long line of ladies that without a doubt never go out without lipstick on.  Even my grandma at 88 would always have her lipstick on at all times.  We seem a little crazy don&#8217;t we?  We aren&#8217;t, I promise&#8230;we only have a slight case of the crazies.  So anyway, this is my fall/winter color that I wear.  I get sorta attached to lipshades and tend to stick with one color for a long long time.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">My iPhone</a>-Because I will never forget the time when I ran out of gas and didn&#8217;t have my cell phone with me and I had to ask the person in the car next to me if I could use their cell to call my husband.  Awful, on so many levels.  At this point, with an iPhone it is also a great toddler distractor as well.</li>
<li><a href="http://patemm.com/">Patemm Pad</a>-Because I have a toddler, I can&#8217;t ever leave home without diaper equipment.  This changing pad is the best changing pad ever and I&#8217;ve told you about it <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2009/11/the-best-changing-pad-ever/">before</a>. I love that this pad can also hold my diapers and wipes and has a handle for carrying.  The best part about this changing pad is that its round and no matter where your kiddo is flailing, the changing pad will generally guard them from the scariness that is public restrooms.  My particular style of Patemm is called the &#8220;Deke&#8221; which I don&#8217;t think they make anymore, but you can definitely find some cuteness on their site.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001IAG7G2/?tag=weea-20">Aquaphor Lip Balm</a>-I can never put lipstick on without first putting a lip balm on and while I have been a devotee of the L&#8217;Occitane Shea Butter Lip Balm, it&#8217;s just too easy to pick up this Aquaphor Lip Balm at the grocery store or drug store.  It also works well in a mini manicure situation on your cuticles.</li>
</ol>
<p>So tell me, what 5 things do you never leave home without?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I went on a glorious honeymoon in Breckenridge, Colorado. No, it isn&#8217;t your typical honeymooner destination and we had our reasons for choosing it, but it was fantastic&#8230;and THAT is a post for another day. Today I am going to have a serious talk with you all regarding a purchase that I made on my honeymoon. I fell deeply and madly in love with &#8230;..a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GZSYFC/?tag=weea-20">leather clutch wallet</a> (sorry husband of mine) made by <a href="http://www.hobobags.com/">Hobo International</a>.  The versatility of the design, the soft leather&#8230; I was like a teen girl on opening night of Twilight, crushing hard. (BTW, I recently watched <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001P5HRMI/?tag=weea-20">Twilight </a>and you may actually see me at the next opening night or stalking <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1500155/">Robert Pattinson</a>, no plans are set in stone yet) So, I purchased the $118.00 wallet, making this the most expensive wallet I have ever owned.  Take a look at her in all her glory&#8230;.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1018" title="der-wallet part 1" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/der-wallet-part-1.png" alt="der-wallet part 1" width="500" height="310" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/der-wallet-part-1.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/der-wallet-part-1-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>So, imagine my surprise when I get home and am browsing my local Target and happen upon <a href="http://www.target.com/Merona-Double-Frame-Wallet-Brown/dp/B002GVIYC2/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;searchView=grid5&amp;frombrowse=0&amp;node=1038576&amp;keywords=clutch%20wallet&amp;field_browse=1038576&amp;searchSize=30&amp;id=Merona%20Double%20Frame%20Wallet%20Brown&amp;field_availability=-2&amp;refinementHistory=subjectbin%2Ctarget_com_age%2Ctarget_com_gender-bin%2Ctarget_com_character-bin%2Cprice%2Ctarget_com_primary_color-bin%2Ctarget_com_size-bin%2Ctarget_com_brand-bin&amp;searchNodeID=1038576&amp;field_launch-date=-1y&amp;searchRank=target104545&amp;searchPage=2&amp;field_keywords=clutch%20wallet">THIS</a>!!
