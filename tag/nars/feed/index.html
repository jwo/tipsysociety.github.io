<p>Let&#8217;s talk makeup! So I&#8217;m of the stick to the same brand forever and ever amen variety in the makeup department but I have switched things up a bit in the last year and I wanted to fill y&#8217;all in on it. This is the stuff I wear every single day&#8230;<br />
<a href="http://www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/product/2330/8195/Makeup/Eyes/Eye-Shadows/Long-Wear-Cream-Shadow/index.tmpl">Long-Wear Cream Shadow &#8211; Ballet Pink</a> This is the most recent addition to my lineup and the color shown here doesn&#8217;t really portray it correctly but it&#8217;s the perfect base shade.  I put this all over my lid all the way up to under my eyebrow.  In the past I have had problems with cream eye shadows&#8230;I seem to have a sensitivity to whatever is in them and they make my eyes hate being alive.  This doesn&#8217;t bother me in the least. AND the great thing about this is that it makes whatever you put on top of it a truer shade, it pops out more.<br />
<a href="http://www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/product/2330/7815/Makeup/Eyes/Eye-Shadows/Shimmer-Wash-Eye-Shadow/index.tmpl">Shimmer Wash Eye Shadow &#8211; Heather Mauve</a> I just love this color. It&#8217;s sort of a mashup of purple and grey and taupe with a touch of shimmer.  And I am NOT a shimmer girl.<br />
<a href="http://www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/product/2328/7785/Makeup/Eyes/Eyeliners/Long-Wear-Gel-Eyeliner/index.tmpl">Long-Wear Gel Eyeliner &#8211; Black Ink</a> I have been using this for years and I will never ever go back to a pencil, you can&#8217;t make me.<br />
<a href="http://www.lauramercier.com/store/shop/Concealers_Secret-Camouflage_prod220004?currentSkuId=sku120002#ColorSampleLink_sku120003">Laura Mercier Secret Camouflage &#8211; SC2</a> My favorite concealer thus far. I use a fat concealer brush from Sephora to apply it.<br />
<a href="http://www.lauramercier.com/store/shop/Foundations_Oil-Free-Supr%EAme-Foundation_prod650002#ColorSampleLink_sku720004">Laura Mercier Oil Free Suprême Foundation &#8211; Blush Ivory</a> I also use a brush to apply this Laura Mercier foundation.  Once I started using a brush to apply foundation I don&#8217;t think I could go back to using a sponge or my fingers, I just think it goes on so much better with a brush.<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006UETCW2/?tag=weea-20+blush+maybelline">Maybelline New York Dream Bouncy Blush &#8211; Peach Satin</a> This was me dipping my toe in the water with regards to cream blush.  I didn&#8217;t want to commit to something expensive because I wasn&#8217;t sure if I was going to like it or not.  So I went cheap and hit the lotto.  When I mentioned that I had started using this to Der she told me to trust her and use it with a regular brush even though its cream.  So I had a leftover foundation brush from a set that I wasn&#8217;t using and went for it and she was SO right! Thank you Der!<br />
<a href="http://www.narscosmetics.com/color/lips/lipstick/semi-matte-lipstick/pigalle">Nars Semi Matte Lipstick &#8211; Pigalle</a> This is also a fairly recent purchase. I&#8217;ve been using Bobbi Brown Lipstick in Brownie for a long long long time and it was getting low and just thought I might try something new. I LOVE this color.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s new with y&#8217;all? What have y&#8217;all recently found and loved?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I thought I&#8217;d share some stuff I&#8217;ve used in the last few months either via a sample or I&#8217;ve purchased and been using, that I&#8217;ve fallen in love with.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004G37P28/?tag=weea-20">Biodroga Intense Moisture Formula Eye Care</a>-I have been on the hunt for an eye cream for what seems like EVER. The problem I run into is that as the day goes by my eyes start burning from certain eye creams. I got a sample of this a while back and used it for a good week without any problems&#8230;that was a first! So I bit the bullet and bought it and I have no clue if it&#8217;s going to make me look 20 years younger but I figure eye cream that doesn&#8217;t cause massive burning is better than no eye cream at all. Right?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0015FSH86/?tag=weea-20">Aquage Beyond Shine Spray</a>-I use this when I&#8217;m done with my hair, but I spray it in my hand first and then run my hands through my hair.  If I spray it directly on my hair it will look DUUUURTEEEEE and I might as well start all over.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P281401&amp;shouldPaginate=true&amp;categoryId=3976#">Nars Pro-Prime Pore Refining Primer &#8211; Oil-Free</a>-I read somewhere that as you get older you will want to use a primer under your foundation so that it falls into all those fine lines and wrinkles and your foundation will go on smoother.  I&#8217;ve tried a couple and then got this as a sample from Sephora and LOVED it. I feel like it makes my pores noticeably smaller and my foundation goes on smooth but also I&#8217;m not an oil slick by the end of the day.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.redken.com/products/styling/heat-styling/hot-sets-22">Redken Hot Sets 22 Thermal Setting Mist</a>-I use this prior to flat ironing my hair.  I like it. I mean there are a lot of different ones out there and I just thought I&#8217;d change it up a bit.  Good stuff.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P266126&amp;om_mmc=aff-linkshare-null-J84DHJLQkR4&amp;_requestid=6769#">Rosebud Salve in a Tube</a>-I&#8217;m a fan of the Rosebud Salve in the little tin, so when I saw this (and I may be behind the times on this being in a tube) I instantly bought it.  It&#8217;s always nice to change up the lip balm every now and then and I love the way this smells.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.folica.com/hair-care/hair-oils-and-serums/jonathan-weightless-smooth-no-frizz-hydrating-balm">Jonathan Product Weightless Smooth No-Frizz Hydrating Balm</a>-I&#8217;m going to venture to say that this product has been LIFE CHANGING. And I&#8217;m two for two on<a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2011/05/hair-dirt/"> Jonathan Product</a> stuff. I think I&#8217;ve said this before but my hair is very thick and naturally wavy but not always in a good way, so I straighten my hair when I want to look presentable.  However, living in the Houston area with humidity 11 out of 12 months of the year, straightening my hair can be challenging.  UNTIL NOW! I got this stuff as a sample and I just thought I&#8217;d give it a shot and OMG the difference it has made in getting my hair straight and KEEPING it straight once I walk outside is unbelievable.  It&#8217;s a keeper.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002UL10HY/?tag=weea-20">Finishing and Blending Face Antibacterial Makeup Brush #955 &#8211; Studio Line by bdellium tools</a>-I&#8217;ve always been the kinda girl that put on her foundation with a sponge, and thought I might try a brush recently and this one didn&#8217;t disappoint.  It&#8217;s kinda crazy how different foundation can look with a brush as opposed to a sponge.  Definitely worth a shot.</li>
