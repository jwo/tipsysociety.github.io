<ol>
<li>Amazon, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003B05XYE/?tag=weea-20">Sour Patch Jelly Beans</a>-Der gave me the heads up on these because she knows I&#8217;m a huge <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">addict</span> fan of Sour Patch kids and man o man are these good!</li>
<li>Amazon, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00150D2WW/?tag=weea-20">Reeses Peanut Butter Egg</a>-One of these has been in my Easter basket every year of my life.  Easter would not be the same without one.</li>
<li>Amazon, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003CIZCRI/?tag=weea-20">Cherry Sours</a>-nope not even remotely Easter but its a Cherry Sour?! Who is going to turn one away.  You do need candy to put in some of those other plastic eggs-COME ON?! And yes that link is to a 10lb case. What.</li>
<li>Candy Warehouse, <a href="http://www.candywarehouse.com/chickduckbunny.html?utm_medium=shoppingengine&amp;utm_source=googlebase&amp;cvsfa=2200&amp;cvsfe=2&amp;cvsfhu=4e37393230302d383838383234">SweeTarts Chicks Ducks Bunnies</a>-SweeTarts are right up there in my fav category and I love when I see a little SweeTart bunny!!</li>
<li>Amazon, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0039K6X4U/?tag=weea-20">Cadbury Eggs</a>-My all time favorite of these would be the Cadbury Chocolate Creme Filled Egg but I haven&#8217;t seen one in any store in TWO YEARS.  What happened? Are they not making the chocolate creme filled anymore???</li>
