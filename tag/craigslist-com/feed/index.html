<p><a href="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/sk-furniture.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2312" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/sk-furniture.png" alt="" width="500" height="268" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/sk-furniture.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/sk-furniture-300x160.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Armoire A:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Is from <a href="http://www.potterybarn.com/shop/furniture-upholstery/media/?cm_type=gnav" target="_blank">Pottery Barn</a>.</li>
<li>30% of the armoire is made of particle board.</li>
<li>This armoire came in two colors: dark stain and red.</li>
<li>It would have taken 8 weeks to be delivered to my house.</li>
<li>The total cost is $2,500, including shipping.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Armoire B:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Is in my living room and was custom made by <a href="http://www.elpasoimportco.com/store_locations" target="_blank">El Paso Import Co</a>.</li>
<li>100% of the armoire is made of solid pine.</li>
<li>This armoire could have been made in any color. (I chose this particular stain because it complimented the rest of my living room furniture.)</li>
<li>It took 4 weeks to be built and delivered to my house.</li>
<li>The total cost was $1,200, including delivery.</li>
</ol>
<p>Custom-built furniture is a great way to save a LOT of money on designer decor. My fellow tipsy girl <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/ak/" target="_blank">AK</a> introduced me to custom-built furniture and gave me a suggestion on where to go to have it done, but I have a great solution if you happen to live in a town that does not have an <a href="http://www.elpasoimportco.com/store_locations" target="_blank">El Paso Import Co</a>., and that is <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites" target="_blank">Craigslist.com</a>.</p>
<p>With a simple search on Craigslist, I found two additional custom furniture builders located in the Houston area and both of their portfolios are impressive.</p>
<p>Here are some good resources and questions to ask before having your furniture made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have some measurements in mind for the size of your furniture.</li>
<li>Take some pictures to highlight the type of furniture you want made.</li>
<li>Ask for references.</li>
<li>Always get an exact price quote in writing before you commit.</li>
</ul>
<p>So before you drop a lot of $$$ on your next furniture investment, do a little online research and see what you can find in your area. Having a piece of locally made, custom, furniture will not only leave a lot more cash in your pocket, but you&#8217;ll also be stimulating your local economy and that just feels good!</p>
