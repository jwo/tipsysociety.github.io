		<description><![CDATA[<p>So I don&#8217;t know if you all heard but they finally came out with a <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/netflix/id363590051?mt=8">Netflix app</a> for the iPhone.  They came out with an iPad app before the iPhone and my husband was super perturbed about that.  But NOW, now we have one for the iPhone!  Basically how it works is anything that is in your instant queue is available to you on your iPhone when you log into the app.  Which means when you need a distraction you have a full season of Blue&#8217;s Clues at your fingertips!  The one with Steve, not Joe.  We like Steve much better.</p>
