		<description><![CDATA[<p>I am determined to complete, by the end of this month, stockings for everyone in the family so that when Christmas decorations come out, everyone in the family has a stocking.  I&#8217;m not a master on the sewing machine but I can do some basics.  So my plan is to do the stocking itself out of felt.  I am going to do names out of material and iron them on via this <a href="http://www.sirbubbadoo.com/2011/08/tutorial-birthday-banner-birthday.html">tutorial</a> on Sir Bubbadoo.   And then I saw in my Sundance catalog, this stocking that has a pocket for your letter to Santa! So I think it&#8217;s all coming together in my mind.  I&#8217;ll post an update of the completed stockings if they don&#8217;t look like total ass.</p>
<p>In other news, did you know that you can get a <a href="http://santasentmealetter.com/category">personalized </a>letter back from Santa after you send yours off? Thanks to <a href="http://www.elleinadspir.com/">Danielle</a>, now I do!</p>
