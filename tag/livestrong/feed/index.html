		<description><![CDATA[<p>The other day I was looking for some sort of calorie tracker app because <a href="http://zenofitness.com/">my trainer</a> was asking me to provide him with a food diary of my week.  Because I&#8217;m lazy and all and don&#8217;t want to write all that crap out with a pen/paper I thought it would be easy to use my handy dandy iPhone.  I hit the jackpot with the <a href="http://www.livestrong.com/thedailyplate/">Livestrong app</a>.  I entered my basic height/weight info and it guided me towards what my daily calories should be.  Upon entering the food I ate throughout the day I found that it had almost everything I ate in its little search engine including the specific HEB cheese slices I put in my pita sandwich at lunch.  On the days I workout I can enter in my activity for calories burned.  After my week of food diary-ing was up, I logged into my Livestrong account online and could print out my food diary and hand it over to my trainer.  Upon review he told me he could see a few problems right off the bat&#8230;hmmm wonder if it was those chewy Sweetarts from last Sunday.  Damn you leftover Easter candy!  I&#8217;m definitely going to make some adjustments and keep going with the app, it&#8217;s sort of addicting!</p>
<p>As a side note, when searching for exercise activities, while it does have a plethora of activities to choose from &#8220;Running after 18 month old child&#8221; was not an option.</p>
