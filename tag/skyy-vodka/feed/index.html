		<description><![CDATA[<p>So here&#8217;s the story of today&#8217;s Hump Day Happy Hour&#8230;my husband and I have some friends that were getting married and wanted to have a signature drink at their wedding.  After the decision was made on which drink they would be having, the next thing that needed to be decided was the name.  Their last name is Powell.  So for the majority of the wedding guests this drink was called the Powelltini, but for the close-knit-friend-crew we started calling these the Powell Panty Droppers because they just go down like water, like pink lemonade, like BUTTUH! And because they can get you in trouble because of said BUTTAH-like qualities.  Go forth, but beware&#8230;</p>
<p>1 part Citron Vodka<br />
1 part frozen lemonade<br />
1 part water<br />
Splash of Chambord</p>
<ul></ul>
