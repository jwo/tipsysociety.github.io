		<description><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been having a bad hair summer. It&#8217;s been ferociously hot and humid here&#8230;more so than years past. And I have wavy, coarse hair, and of course I try and straighten it and it just frizzes right out when I walk outside.  It&#8217;s much happier in the winter.</p>
<p>So I decided to change up my hair products to see what I can do and here is what I&#8217;m working with now:</p>

<li><a href="http://shop.avon.com/shop/product.aspx?code=&amp;level1_id=300&amp;level2_id=341&amp;pdept_id=682&amp;pf_id=39549&amp;level=3">Avon Lotus Shield</a>-Sarah over at <a href="http://www.hairthursday.com/?p=4360">Hair Thursday</a> introduced me to this and <a href="http://twitter.com/AWo/status/21703433089">this</a> is what I had to say about it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GZBWHO/?tag=weea-20">Osis Flattening Liquid</a>-The lady that cuts my hair introduced this to me. I had been using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BX5FS8/?tag=weea-20">Chi Straight Guard</a> and felt like it was weighing my hair down a bit much. She told me that I needed different products in different weather.  This flattening liquid is like a very lightweight gel as opposed to a creme.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.paulmitchell.com/PRODUCTS/PAULMITCHELL/EXPRESSSTYLE/Pages/HotOffThePress.aspx">Paul Mitchell Hot Off the Press</a>-I alternate between this and some other thermal guard sprays before I straighten my hair and this one seems to be working at the moment.</li>
