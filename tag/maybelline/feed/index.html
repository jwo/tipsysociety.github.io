<p>Let&#8217;s talk makeup! So I&#8217;m of the stick to the same brand forever and ever amen variety in the makeup department but I have switched things up a bit in the last year and I wanted to fill y&#8217;all in on it. This is the stuff I wear every single day&#8230;<br />
<a href="http://www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/product/2330/8195/Makeup/Eyes/Eye-Shadows/Long-Wear-Cream-Shadow/index.tmpl">Long-Wear Cream Shadow &#8211; Ballet Pink</a> This is the most recent addition to my lineup and the color shown here doesn&#8217;t really portray it correctly but it&#8217;s the perfect base shade.  I put this all over my lid all the way up to under my eyebrow.  In the past I have had problems with cream eye shadows&#8230;I seem to have a sensitivity to whatever is in them and they make my eyes hate being alive.  This doesn&#8217;t bother me in the least. AND the great thing about this is that it makes whatever you put on top of it a truer shade, it pops out more.<br />
<a href="http://www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/product/2330/7815/Makeup/Eyes/Eye-Shadows/Shimmer-Wash-Eye-Shadow/index.tmpl">Shimmer Wash Eye Shadow &#8211; Heather Mauve</a> I just love this color. It&#8217;s sort of a mashup of purple and grey and taupe with a touch of shimmer.  And I am NOT a shimmer girl.<br />
<a href="http://www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/product/2328/7785/Makeup/Eyes/Eyeliners/Long-Wear-Gel-Eyeliner/index.tmpl">Long-Wear Gel Eyeliner &#8211; Black Ink</a> I have been using this for years and I will never ever go back to a pencil, you can&#8217;t make me.<br />
<a href="http://www.lauramercier.com/store/shop/Concealers_Secret-Camouflage_prod220004?currentSkuId=sku120002#ColorSampleLink_sku120003">Laura Mercier Secret Camouflage &#8211; SC2</a> My favorite concealer thus far. I use a fat concealer brush from Sephora to apply it.<br />
<a href="http://www.lauramercier.com/store/shop/Foundations_Oil-Free-Supr%EAme-Foundation_prod650002#ColorSampleLink_sku720004">Laura Mercier Oil Free Suprême Foundation &#8211; Blush Ivory</a> I also use a brush to apply this Laura Mercier foundation.  Once I started using a brush to apply foundation I don&#8217;t think I could go back to using a sponge or my fingers, I just think it goes on so much better with a brush.<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006UETCW2/?tag=weea-20+blush+maybelline">Maybelline New York Dream Bouncy Blush &#8211; Peach Satin</a> This was me dipping my toe in the water with regards to cream blush.  I didn&#8217;t want to commit to something expensive because I wasn&#8217;t sure if I was going to like it or not.  So I went cheap and hit the lotto.  When I mentioned that I had started using this to Der she told me to trust her and use it with a regular brush even though its cream.  So I had a leftover foundation brush from a set that I wasn&#8217;t using and went for it and she was SO right! Thank you Der!<br />
<a href="http://www.narscosmetics.com/color/lips/lipstick/semi-matte-lipstick/pigalle">Nars Semi Matte Lipstick &#8211; Pigalle</a> This is also a fairly recent purchase. I&#8217;ve been using Bobbi Brown Lipstick in Brownie for a long long long time and it was getting low and just thought I might try something new. I LOVE this color.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s new with y&#8217;all? What have y&#8217;all recently found and loved?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Time for a another weigh in.  Mascara.  This is something I hold near and dear to my heart.  Or something I accidentally poke my eye with and ensure the worst.pain.known.to.a.woman.</p>
<p>Here we go&#8230;.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3307" title="group-mascara" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/group-mascara.png" alt="" width="500" height="559" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/group-mascara.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/group-mascara-268x300.png 268w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>Sarah:  <a title="Sarah" href="https://shop.beauticontrol.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10551&amp;productId=39940&amp;langId=-1" target="_blank">SpectacuLash® Mascara (Black)</a> I like this mascara because it gives me the long, thick, eyelashes I want, without ever being too clumpy.</p>
<p>Der:  <a title="Der" href="http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.asp?pid=179656&amp;catid=98577&amp;cmbProdBrandFilter=53084" target="_blank">Loreal Voluminous Mascara</a> This is one of the only makeup products that I repeatedly buy. I like plump, black lashes and this is the best drug store mascara that I have found for that affect. Also, the makeup artist that I hired on my wedding day&#8230;. showed up with this mascara in her bag of tricks, so it must be good 🙂</p>
<p>AK:  <a title="AK" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002ZTZVC6/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Maybelline Lash Stilleto</a> It&#8217;s not goopy and clumpy and it separates my lashes perfectly!  And it actually comes off as opposed to sticking to your lashes for days on end.</p>
<p>Court:  <a title="Court" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001ADOV4W/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Loreal Telescopic Definition Lengthening</a> I&#8217;ve tried almost every new mascara that comes out and I always end up sticking to this.  I love the comb like brush, even though you better learn to use it and learn to use it fast.  Lets just say combing through caked on lashes doesn&#8217;t end up with the neatest look.  However, don&#8217;t let that scare you gals, once you get the hang of it this mascara never fails to provide clean, defined, long lashes that really pop.</p>

<p>AK:  <a title="AK" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002ZTZVC6/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Maybelline Lash Stilleto</a> It&#8217;s not goopy and clumpy and it separates my lashes perfectly!  And it actually comes off as opposed to sticking to your lashes for days on end.</p>
<p>Court:  <a title="Court" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001ADOV4W/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Loreal Telescopic Definition Lengthening</a> I&#8217;ve tried almost every new mascara that comes out and I always end up sticking to this.  I love the comb like brush, even though you better learn to use it and learn to use it fast.  Lets just say combing through caked on lashes doesn&#8217;t end up with the neatest look.  However, don&#8217;t let that scare you gals, once you get the hang of it this mascara never fails to provide clean, defined, long lashes that really pop.</p>

I like plump, black lashes and this is the best drug store mascara that I have found for that affect.

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t always wear the same make-up every day, like a lot of my Tipsy girls do, but I can tell you that I have noticed that when I am in a hurry&#8230; I reach for my tried and true staples. Here they are.. the best of the best from a drug store make-upaholic.</p>
<ol>
<li>Maybelline, <a href="http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.asp?pid=211912&amp;catid=9562&amp;cmbProdBrandFilter=60065">Expert Wear Blush </a>in Apricot Flush- the perfect pinched my cheeks flush I need to keep from looking like a zombie and it seems to stay on all day.</li>
<li>Covergirl, <a href="http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.asp?pid=159595&amp;catid=98577&amp;cmbProdBrandFilter=48640">Lash Exact Mascara</a> in Black- This is my daily mascara. It&#8217;s so clean and doesn&#8217;t flake or clump at all.</li>
<li>Maybelline, <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=12443604">Superstay Silky Foundation </a>&#8211; I saw this foundation used on Tim Gunn&#8217;s Guide to Style ( um, sad about that cancellation BTW) and so I had to try it out.  It&#8217;s awesome! Stays on all day and is light as a feather.</li>
<li>Maybelline, <a href="http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.asp?pid=192470&amp;catid=98578&amp;cmbProdBrandFilter=56416">Experwear Single Eyeshadow </a>in Creme De Cocoa- Neutral and slightly shimmery and easy to wear or blend with other colors.</li>
<li>Covergirl, <a href="http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.asp?pid=159602&amp;catid=98579&amp;cmbProdBrandFilter=47323">Outlast Smoothwear Eyeliner </a> in Espresso- goes on so smooth and stays on like no other.</li>
<li>Hardcandy, <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=12441141">Honeymoon Peach Blush</a>&#8211; I pop one sweep of this over my cheekbones, on top of my regular blush.  This is a recent find and I don&#8217;t know how I ever lived without it.</li>
