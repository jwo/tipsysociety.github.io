<p>Let&#8217;s talk makeup! So I&#8217;m of the stick to the same brand forever and ever amen variety in the makeup department but I have switched things up a bit in the last year and I wanted to fill y&#8217;all in on it. This is the stuff I wear every single day&#8230;<br />
<a href="http://www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/product/2330/8195/Makeup/Eyes/Eye-Shadows/Long-Wear-Cream-Shadow/index.tmpl">Long-Wear Cream Shadow &#8211; Ballet Pink</a> This is the most recent addition to my lineup and the color shown here doesn&#8217;t really portray it correctly but it&#8217;s the perfect base shade.  I put this all over my lid all the way up to under my eyebrow.  In the past I have had problems with cream eye shadows&#8230;I seem to have a sensitivity to whatever is in them and they make my eyes hate being alive.  This doesn&#8217;t bother me in the least. AND the great thing about this is that it makes whatever you put on top of it a truer shade, it pops out more.<br />
<a href="http://www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/product/2330/7815/Makeup/Eyes/Eye-Shadows/Shimmer-Wash-Eye-Shadow/index.tmpl">Shimmer Wash Eye Shadow &#8211; Heather Mauve</a> I just love this color. It&#8217;s sort of a mashup of purple and grey and taupe with a touch of shimmer.  And I am NOT a shimmer girl.<br />
<a href="http://www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/product/2328/7785/Makeup/Eyes/Eyeliners/Long-Wear-Gel-Eyeliner/index.tmpl">Long-Wear Gel Eyeliner &#8211; Black Ink</a> I have been using this for years and I will never ever go back to a pencil, you can&#8217;t make me.<br />
<a href="http://www.lauramercier.com/store/shop/Concealers_Secret-Camouflage_prod220004?currentSkuId=sku120002#ColorSampleLink_sku120003">Laura Mercier Secret Camouflage &#8211; SC2</a> My favorite concealer thus far. I use a fat concealer brush from Sephora to apply it.<br />
<a href="http://www.lauramercier.com/store/shop/Foundations_Oil-Free-Supr%EAme-Foundation_prod650002#ColorSampleLink_sku720004">Laura Mercier Oil Free Suprême Foundation &#8211; Blush Ivory</a> I also use a brush to apply this Laura Mercier foundation.  Once I started using a brush to apply foundation I don&#8217;t think I could go back to using a sponge or my fingers, I just think it goes on so much better with a brush.<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006UETCW2/?tag=weea-20+blush+maybelline">Maybelline New York Dream Bouncy Blush &#8211; Peach Satin</a> This was me dipping my toe in the water with regards to cream blush.  I didn&#8217;t want to commit to something expensive because I wasn&#8217;t sure if I was going to like it or not.  So I went cheap and hit the lotto.  When I mentioned that I had started using this to Der she told me to trust her and use it with a regular brush even though its cream.  So I had a leftover foundation brush from a set that I wasn&#8217;t using and went for it and she was SO right! Thank you Der!<br />
<a href="http://www.narscosmetics.com/color/lips/lipstick/semi-matte-lipstick/pigalle">Nars Semi Matte Lipstick &#8211; Pigalle</a> This is also a fairly recent purchase. I&#8217;ve been using Bobbi Brown Lipstick in Brownie for a long long long time and it was getting low and just thought I might try something new. I LOVE this color.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s new with y&#8217;all? What have y&#8217;all recently found and loved?</p>
