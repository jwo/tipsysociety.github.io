		<description><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m a huge fan of giving the gift of a class or experience.  It&#8217;s probably not the first thing you think of but they are a huge hit and so fun.  Here&#8217;s some ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>One year my mom got my dad a new fancy schmancy camera, so I got him a class on how to use that camera.  Give the gift of a photography class.</li>
<li>My husband loves to cook, last year I had a local chef come to our house to teach him how to make a classic french meal.  Give a private or group cooking class!</li>
<li>How bout skydiving!  If you are willing to do a tandem jump you don&#8217;t have to be there for some 8 hour class to learn how to jump on your own.</li>
<li>Knitting/Crocheting/Sewing classes&#8230;last year I got a sewing machine and also got a &#8220;Get to Know your Sewing Machine&#8221; class.  It was awesome.  I&#8217;m hoping this year I&#8217;ll relearn crocheting.</li>
<li>Guitar Lessons was a gift my dad gave my mom one year.</li>
<li>Wine Tasting! Learn more about wine and get a little Tipsy at the same time!</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you give these types of gifts? If so, what have you given? I&#8217;d love to hear!!</p>
