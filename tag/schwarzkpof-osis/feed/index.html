		<description><![CDATA[<p>I have a confession.</p>
<p>I have thin hair. I pretty much have no more hair on my head now than what God gave me the day I entered this world. That being said, I have found the holy grail of hair products. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001OXJDEG/?tag=weea-20">Schwarkopf Osis Dust It Mattifying Powder</a> (I just call it Osis because I can&#8217;t say that word either ðŸ™‚ ).Â  You just sprinkle a little on your roots, tease it with your fingers, and you have volume. Its a miracle.</p>
<p>If I want to get really crazy, I use Dust It along with Redkin Wool Shake that Sarah mentioned <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/07/someone-help-me/">before</a>. Talk about volume&#8230;</p>
