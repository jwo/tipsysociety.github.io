		<description><![CDATA[<p>So if you are like most people you have some area in your house or office that you have something that you plug in and unplug quite often (i.e.  your cell phone, your laptop, etc etc).  And I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever unplugged said cell phone and your cord drops behind an item of furniture that you would have to MOVE to retrieve the cord and you are all SONUVA!  So I think these things look quite helpful.  What say you?  And they&#8217;re cute to boot!</p>
