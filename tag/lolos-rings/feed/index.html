		<description><![CDATA[<p>Rings!  I LOVE bright funky rings!  One funky ring can add just the pop of color an outfit needs.  I was just browsing Etsy one day&#8230;like I do <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">every</span> most days.  Shut up, everyone does it. Wait. What? You don&#8217;t browse Etsy EVERYDAY??  Loser.  So anyway, I ran across <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/lolosrings">Lo Lo&#8217;s Rings</a> and fell in love with the <a href="http://www.etsy.com/view_transaction.php?transaction_id=9295776">Crabby Patties Ring</a>.  You would not believe what I can wear this ring with&#8230;ALOT, trust me.  Lo Lo&#8217;s Rings are super comfy because they have elastic cords for the band.  I&#8217;ve been eyeing the <a href="http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?listing_id=11781705">Iced Blueberry Ring</a> for a while&#8230;which one are you going after?</p>
