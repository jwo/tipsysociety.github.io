		<description><![CDATA[<p>I promise I&#8217;ll stop inundating you with Mexico soon!  Our last trip we took to Mexico was to San Miguel de Allende.  We stayed at a very very cool placed called <a href="http://www.doscasas.com.mx/index.php/san-miguel-de-allende-hotel">Dos Casas</a>.  It&#8217;s a pretty small boutique hotel.  Several days we asked if we could sit in the kitchen and watch them make our breakfast which was THE. BOMB!  The bartender taught us the correct way to sip tequila and mezcal and was just as nice as could be.  My husband had a momentary lapse and thought that mezcal=absinthe and he thought if he drank it he&#8217;d cut his ear off ala Van Gogh, but then realized mezcal is just tequila and ended up quite liking it.</p>
<p>We took a couple of home tours in San Miguel de Allende and let me tell you, the homes are FABULOUS!  We also took a side trip to Dolores Hidalgo which is where they make a ton of Talavera pottery.  We got to watch the entire Talavera making process and then purchased WAY TOO MUCH of it.  Like I said, I love me some Mexico.</p>
<p>Still pining away for Mexico&#8230;anybody been anywhere else in Mexico that you feel I NEED to go to?  PLEASE DO TELL!</p>
