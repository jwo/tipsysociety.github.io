		<description><![CDATA[<p>In terms of an overnight diaper we always just by default picked up <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3162029&amp;CAWELAID=211636074">Huggies Overnights</a>, even though we use Pampers during the day.  I couldn&#8217;t tell you how many times we would deal with leakage in the morning, so we ended up getting things called diaper doublers that we would put inside of the Huggies Overnights to absorb even more.  A couple of weeks ago we saw these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0028MKCP6/?tag=weea-20">Pampers Extra Protection</a> diapers and decided why not?  Worth a shot right? So we tried them without the diaper doubler and lo and behold no leakage.  We&#8217;ve been using them for a few weeks now and haven&#8217;t had any leakage whatsoever.  It&#8217;s crazy because they are so much thinner feeling than Huggies and yet, no leakage.  Anybody else a Pampers Extra Protection fan?</p>
