		<description><![CDATA[<p>Your Sig-other is always talking about Hertz, or HDMI, or H-something-something-yada-yada-yada, right? If so, here&#8217;s a list of gift ideas for the geek on the go. You can also read about my <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2009/12/guy-gift-guide-chef-edition/">guy gift guide for chef guys</a>.</p>
<p>But a secret about most geeky guys I know &#8212; we all like to envision ourselves travelers, even if the most we ever get out is to the grocery store for nonfat organic milk. Wait, I mean the liquor store for liquor, amirite??</p>
<p>umm, ok, so on to the gifts:</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1508" title="jw-gift tech" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/jw-gift-tech.png" alt="jw-gift tech" width="500" height="671" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/jw-gift-tech.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/jw-gift-tech-223x300.png 223w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001FWH0A0/?tag=weea-20">Cradlepoint Travel Router</a> $98 &#8211; Plugin your 3G usb card into the router and it creates a wifi hotspot for you. So if your family is driving across the country, you power up your laptop and this cradlepoint into your power inverter (gives you a real power plug from your car), and then watch Hulu all the way to grandma&#8217;s house!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VXKD8K/?tag=weea-20">SlingBox Solo</a> $179 &#8211; OK, so get this. You leave the slingbox at home, hooked up to your Tivo or cablebox or satellite or whatever. You then go on a trip, get on wifi, and then either with your computer or with your iTouch/iPhone and run the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=309280605&amp;mt=8">slingbox app</a> (there&#8217;s also a blackberry version). Then you watch your home tv live and control it. People, I&#8217;m talking pay $8 for hotel internet, then watch your home DVR collection of Lost or the football game from earlier that night. Magic meets the future!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000O26134/?tag=weea-20">Survival Kit in a Can</a> $14 &#8211; So if your guy is like me, he thinks he could survive on his own in the wilderness. I mean how hard is survivor <em>really</em> ? With this kit, he (and by he I of course mean I) might have a change for another 24 hours on his own. At least until the pizza arrives. I also thought this book on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0312331223/?tag=weea-20">US Armed Services Survival Guide</a> was cool looking.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002M3SOBU/?tag=weea-20">iPod Touch</a> $181 &#8211; If he doesn&#8217;t have an iPhone, he&#8217;ll want this just to download and install apps. I personally make due on the phone side with an old blackberry and use the iTouch (iPod Touch = iTouch) for a ton of stuff. Like the grocery shopping app, or the Amazon Kindle Reader app. Best part = no monthly fees!</li>
<li><a href="https://thejoojoo.com/">TheJooJoo</a> $499 &#8211; ok, so this is a bit risky, but if you want to truly wow your techie sig&#8217;other, this is a gift to show him that you like him a lot. The &#8220;joojoo&#8221; (means magic) was originally going to be the &#8220;CrunchPad&#8221;, but it morphed into this tablet PC that I personally think is going to rock. At $499 its a bit expensive, but for couch web browsing it will be most awesome.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002KCA85I/?tag=weea-20">Western Digital HardDrive</a> $109 &#8211; I&#8217;ve had external harddrives before, but honestly they were way too &#8220;external&#8221; &#8212; this fits in your pocket or bag and lets you keep a backup of your videos and pictures. If you have a Tivo, use TivoToGo to copy over shows and movies before your trip &#8230; if you don&#8217;t have a tivo, umm why?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017U8FTU/?tag=weea-20">Wilife Security System</a> $279 &#8211; A security system that you can login into from the road and check out what&#8217;s going on at the homestead. Also, it detects motion and starts recording, so if someone does break into your house it&#8217;ll have evidence for you. How this hasn&#8217;t made CSI yet I have no idea.</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your Sig-other is always talking about Hertz, or HDMI, or H-something-something-yada-yada-yada, right? If so, here&#8217;s a list of gift ideas for the geek on the go. You can also read about my <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2009/12/guy-gift-guide-chef-edition/">guy gift guide for chef guys</a>.</p>
<p>But a secret about most geeky guys I know &#8212; we all like to envision ourselves travelers, even if the most we ever get out is to the grocery store for nonfat organic milk. Wait, I mean the liquor store for liquor, amirite??</p>
<p>umm, ok, so on to the gifts:</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1508" title="jw-gift tech" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/jw-gift-tech.png" alt="jw-gift tech" width="500" height="671" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/jw-gift-tech.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/jw-gift-tech-223x300.png 223w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>

<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001FWH0A0/?tag=weea-20">Cradlepoint Travel Router</a> $98 &#8211; Plugin your 3G usb card into the router and it creates a wifi hotspot for you. So if your family is driving across the country, you power up your laptop and this cradlepoint into your power inverter (gives you a real power plug from your car), and then watch Hulu all the way to grandma&#8217;s house!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VXKD8K/?tag=weea-20">SlingBox Solo</a> $179 &#8211; OK, so get this. You leave the slingbox at home, hooked up to your Tivo or cablebox or satellite or whatever. You then go on a trip, get on wifi, and then either with your computer or with your iTouch/iPhone and run the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=309280605&amp;mt=8">slingbox app</a> (there&#8217;s also a blackberry version). Then you watch your home tv live and control it. People, I&#8217;m talking pay $8 for hotel internet, then watch your home DVR collection of Lost or the football game from earlier that night. Magic meets the future!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000O26134/?tag=weea-20">Survival Kit in a Can</a> $14 &#8211; So if your guy is like me, he thinks he could survive on his own in the wilderness. I mean how hard is survivor <em>really</em> ? With this kit, he (and by he I of course mean I) might have a change for another 24 hours on his own. At least until the pizza arrives. I also thought this book on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0312331223/?tag=weea-20">US Armed Services Survival Guide</a> was cool looking.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002M3SOBU/?tag=weea-20">iPod Touch</a> $181 &#8211; If he doesn&#8217;t have an iPhone, he&#8217;ll want this just to download and install apps. I personally make due on the phone side with an old blackberry and use the iTouch (iPod Touch = iTouch) for a ton of stuff. Like the grocery shopping app, or the Amazon Kindle Reader app. Best part = no monthly fees!</li>
<li><a href="https://thejoojoo.com/">TheJooJoo</a> $499 &#8211; ok, so this is a bit risky, but if you want to truly wow your techie sig&#8217;other, this is a gift to show him that you like him a lot. The &#8220;joojoo&#8221; (means magic) was originally going to be the &#8220;CrunchPad&#8221;, but it morphed into this tablet PC that I personally think is going to rock. At $499 its a bit expensive, but for couch web browsing it will be most awesome.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002KCA85I/?tag=weea-20">Western Digital HardDrive</a> $109 &#8211; I&#8217;ve had external harddrives before, but honestly they were way too &#8220;external&#8221; &#8212; this fits in your pocket or bag and lets you keep a backup of your videos and pictures. If you have a Tivo, use TivoToGo to copy over shows and movies before your trip &#8230; if you don&#8217;t have a tivo, umm why?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0017U8FTU/?tag=weea-20">Wilife Security System</a> $279 &#8211; A security system that you can login into from the road and check out what&#8217;s going on at the homestead. Also, it detects motion and starts recording, so if someone does break into your house it&#8217;ll have evidence for you. How this hasn&#8217;t made CSI yet I have no idea.</li>
