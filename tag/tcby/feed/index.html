<ol>
<li>Sarah: <a href="http://www.bluebell.com/IceCreamFlavor?fid=18" target="_blank">Blue Bell Cookies and Cream</a>, This has been my all time favorite since I was little. I don&#8217;t eat a ton of ice creamÂ (and my ass thanks me for that), but if I ever have a craving, you can bet that I&#8217;m headed straight for Blue Bell Cookies and Cream!!!! (And yes, it has to be Blue Bell&#8230;)</li>
<li>AK: <a href="http://www.bluebell.com/IceCreamFlavor?fid=21" target="_blank">Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla</a>, When it comes to ice cream I&#8217;m very plain jane.Â  I&#8217;m a huge fan of Der&#8217;s pick but if I&#8217;m buying ice cream at the grocery store or somewhere not McDonald&#8217;s then I&#8217;m definitely going with Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla.Â  And like Sarah said, yes it has to be Blue Bell.</li>
<li>Court: <a href="http://tcby.com/" target="_blank">TCBY White Chocolate Mousse</a>, TCBY&#8217;s White Chocolate Mousse.Â  Easy on the cals, awesome ass flavor.Â  I always, always add sprinkles to mine.Â  I don&#8217;t really keep ice cream in the house, and there is a probably a reason for that ðŸ™‚</li>
<li>Der: <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en/food/full_menu/desserts_and_shakes/vanilla_reduced_fat_ice_cream_cone.html" target="_blank">McDonalds Vanilla Cone</a>, There will never ever be an ice cream that will beat McDonald&#8217;s ice cream cones in my book. I used this as my weight loss crutch back in the day.. it&#8217;s low cal and mighty delish!</li>
