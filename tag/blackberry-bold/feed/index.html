		<description><![CDATA[<h2>Blackberry Bold vs. iPhone</h2>
<p>So, my husband got an iPhone circa 2008 and I thought it was the most RIDICULOUS purchase ever. However, now that everyone, including my mother, has one, I&#8217;m starting to reconsider its coolness factor. The only thing I&#8217;m concerned about is the emailing capabilities and the touch keypad on the iPhone, which, I&#8217;m told, I will get used to, but the thing is that I really do use my blackberry for daily business emailing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to get a new phone within the next two weeks and I&#8217;m torn between these two phones. Remember, this phone will be used a lot for business.</p>
<p><strong>What phone will be best for my needs? </strong></p>
<p>(All thoughts and opinions greatly appreciated!)</p>
