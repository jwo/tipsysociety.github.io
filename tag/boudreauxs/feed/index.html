<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001FB5INW/?tag=weea-20">Aquaphor Baby Healing Ointment</a>-For all over, this stuff is thick and we&#8217;ve used this head to toe, especially now when the cold wind is a whippin&#8217;.  The bonus with this stuff is that after you&#8217;ve slathered the kiddo, you can rub this into your cuticles for a little mini mani!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002R4Y3IM/?tag=weea-20">method baby Squeaky Green Body Lotion</a>-We use this mainly for our little guy&#8217;s legs and knocks those dry spots out pretty quick.</li>
