		<description><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re going to let you guys in on a little Tipsy secret, we are TV people!!!! We watch a lot of TV and we talk a lot about TV, but oddly enough, our favorites are all different!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s ours, what are yours? (And how often are you hooked on the tube?)</p>
<ol>
<li>Der: Modern Family, I&#8217;m completely head over heels for Modern Family. The characters on that show could not have been more well cast and every single week I am laughing out loud at the shennanigans that goes on with that show. My only complaint is that I honestly wish it was longer than 30 mins.</li>
<li>AK: The Good Wife, Only in its second season, The Good Wife has quickly turned into a &#8220;watch the night of&#8221; show for us in our household.  That&#8217;s a big deal, because we TiVo EVERYTHING and rarely watch things as they are on live that night.  But The Good Wife, it&#8217;s that good, I&#8217;m telling you!</li>
<li>Sarah: Private Practice, this is literally the only show right now that I HAVE to watch the night of. The story lines just keep getting better and better&#8230;and if anyone saw the previews for this Thursdays episode, I know you&#8217;re on the edge of your seat right now!!!</li>
<li>Court: The Office, This is a show I know a lot of people have jumped ship on; however this remains my absolute fav on the air right now. I laugh my ass off to the antics, one liners, and shit the characters do on this show&#8230;.&#8221;you went over my head and then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating&#8221;. Bahahahaaaa!</li>
</ol>
