		<description><![CDATA[<p>I saw this idea a while back on <a href="http://www.ohdeedoh.com/ohdeedoh/clean-up-time/quick-tip-use-magnetic-knife-holders-for-storage-138696">ohdeedoh.com</a> and thought it was FABULOUS! Basically, you take all your die-cast cars and organize them on a magnetic knife rack which you can buy at ikea (they range from $2.49 to $14.99)!  Currently our cars go in a big basket, but it might be cool to setup these magnetic knife racks in my son&#8217;s room either on the wall in a cool design, or in a closet, or on a closet door&#8230;wow my mind is just spinning with the possibilities!</p>
<p>What do you think? How do you keep up with all those cars?</p>
