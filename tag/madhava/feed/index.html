		<description><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="http://teraraestephens.com/">friend</a> recently shared this recipe with my husband and since I&#8217;m not one to ever turn away a margarita, I had to try one. And since these are basically guilt-free libations we will definitely be partaking in them pretty regularly at our casa.  You will want to try these, trust me.</p>
<p>1oz silver tequila<br />
11/2 to 2 oz fresh lime juice<br />
Agave syrup to taste<br />
Splash of soda water<br />
Over crushed ice</p>
