These tennis shoes are THE BOMB. Initially I had purchased these for both of my boys but then I saw that they offered them in adult sizes too and now my husband and I both wear them as well. They have arch support unlike Converse, so they are super comfy in my book.  My husband also has been wearing them a ton and says they are the most comfortable tennis shoe he has aside from his workout tennis shoes.  The boys shoes have held up very well, my oldest wears his to school everyday and just keep on truckin. The best part of these shoes? ALL OF THE COLORS. SO MANY COLORS.<br />

A while back I ended up with an Anthony for Men sample in my Sephora bag and I asked my husband if he wanted to try it out or throw it away.  He said he&#8217;d try it. A little while after that we received a package from Amazon with some more of the Anthony for Men products and I was all oh I guess you liked that stuff huh?  Turns out he loves it.  So if you are looking for a last minute Valentine idea, this might be it!</p>

I have lots of shoes, in lots of colors. But this past year has been pretty tough so I decided at some point (probably when I was wracking my brain for what to wear one day and was absolutely run into the ground) that I needed to just buy some nice looking comfortable flats that will go with EVERYTHING and I won&#8217;t have to THINK. So without further ado&#8230;the flats/moccasins/loafers that I&#8217;ve been living in for the past year (aside from flip flops in the summer):<br />
<a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/vince-camuto-ellen-flat/3436980?origin=keywordsearch&#038;contextualcategoryid=0&#038;fashionColor=CARAMEL&#038;resultback=0">Vince Camuto &#8216;Ellen&#8217; Flat &#8211; Caramel</a> This one and the black flat are the exact same shoe, different color.  I bought the black ones first and wore them so much because they are SO COMFORTABLE that I bought the caramel just recently.<br />
<a href="http://www.zappos.com/minnetonka-kilty-suede-moc-brown-suede">Minnetonka Kilty Suede Moc &#8211; Brown Suede</a> These might be the closest thing to wearing slippers outside of your house you can get. SOOOOOOO comfortable.<br />

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005C2UBYQ/?tag=weea-20+tan">Lacoste Women&#8217;s Concours &#8211; Tan Suede</a> LOVE LOVE LOVE these, again..very comfortable. I couldn&#8217;t find the exact ones that I own which are tan suede, but they are this same exact style.  There are some really cute ones in this same style that are out right now that are brown with a berry colored detail&#8211;super duper cute.</p>
