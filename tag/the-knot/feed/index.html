		<description><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve all got a few ideas of things for Christen&#8217;s wedding that we couldn&#8217;t quite categorize, so we are just going to call them &#8220;special touches&#8221;.</p>
<ol>
<li>Der-<a href="http://www.papertastebuds.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/thank-you-card-paperfinger.jpg">This</a> is something I WISH I would have done at my wedding! So easy.. just find two seconds (easier said than done) in your busy reception time hold the sign saying Thank You and voila! Turn it into super adorable thank you cards for all those wedding gifts that you rake in!</li>
<li>AK-I wish I had done <a href="http://media.theknot.com/ImageStage/Objects/0003/0059155/large_image.jpg">this</a> at my wedding&#8230;Too cute to have an ampersand hanging from the Bride &amp; Groom&#8217;s chairs.  I think I would have done the ampersand at my wedding covered in Zinnias.  Christen could do hers in moss or maybe orange mum flowers.  So pretty!</li>
<li>Sarah-After the reception is over, the getaway makes for a great photo-op. My sister used sparklers at her late September wedding and the pictures turned out to be some of the best from the entire day&#8230;they are inexpensive and a great way to end a fabulous day!</li>
<li>Court-I love the personal touch of having guests <a href="http://www.brendasweddingblog.com/storage/wedding-outlet-guest-books.jpg">sign a picture</a> frame or plate, something the couple can keep and cherish for their lifetime.  Most people I know that have done this have this out and part of their decor in their house.  Its such a cute reminder of that special day.</li>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>We are going to be running a series here over the next few weeks.  It&#8217;s called The Tipsy Wedding Project aka help <a href="http://isthisthingonckd.wordpress.com/">Christen</a> design her wedding.  Christen is an avid Tipsy Society reader and we could not say no when she asked for a little assistance in planning her October 2010 nuptials.  So each week us Tipsy gals will be throwing some suggestions her way and letting YOU the readers vote on WHAT SHOULD CHRISTEN PICK!  So here goes&#8230;this week is all about bouquets!!</p>
<ol>
<li>Der-I&#8217;m in LOVE with this <a href="http://theoceansidebride.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/fall-wedding-ideas-fall-bouquet-2_s600x600.jpg">fall bouquet</a>!  I think this bouquet ties in the truffle color that she has picked for her attendants and it adds pops of orange and green and even some pink. I love the rustic looking shape of this bouquet and I think this could easily transcend into a larger scale table arrangement&#8230; OR to save money just have the bride and all the maids place their bouquets in beautiful vases on all the tables.</li>
<li>Court-I&#8217;m going to keep things simple with this <a href="http://cdn.overstock.com/images/products/P11885501.jpg">bouquet</a> so that the orange color and single flower type make things pop even more.</li>
<li>AK-<a href="http://www.stylemepretty.com/2009/10/20/fall-flower-inspiration-by-jessicas-country-flowers/">This bouquet</a> is so RICH in color and I believe that&#8217;s what Christen is going for.  This combines roses, lilies (calla), and a tiny bit of hydrangea.  I love the berries and seeded eucalyptus which can be incorporated into some badass boutonnieres when we get to those.</li>
<li>Sarah-I love the idea of the bridal bouquet being different than her bridesmaids, so this is what I came up with <a href="http://weddings.theknot.com/Real-Weddings/46712/detailview.aspx?id=46712&amp;type=3&amp;wedding+details=Bridal+Bouquets&amp;pageIndex=11">for the bridesmaids</a> and <a href="http://weddings.theknot.com/Real-Weddings/40471/detailview.aspx?id=40471&amp;type=3&amp;wedding+details=Bridal+Bouquets&amp;pageIndex=17">for the bride</a>, it combines both the colors, and flowers, she&#8217;s looking for, and, since both bouquets are the same shape, they tie together nicely. (I&#8217;m also in LOVE with the copper wire that&#8217;s wrapped around the bridesmaids bouquets!)</li>
</ol>
<p>So Tipsy readers&#8230;here&#8217;s your chance&#8230;Which one should Christen pick?<br />
