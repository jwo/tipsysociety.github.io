		<description><![CDATA[<p>You guys, I saw <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/852771/fanged-pumpkins">this</a> via Pinterest and I just about died from the cuteness! I SOOOOO want to make these this year for Halloween.  I&#8217;m wondering  how long they will last after carving before they start to look all shrunken and gross?</p>
<p>Do you carve a pumpkin every year? Do you get creative or do the same old thing every year?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>If you are having Thanksgiving at your house and want to spruce up your table with a centerpiece, Martha Stewart has some great ideas on her site.  Most of these would be super duper easy to throw together.  The easiest being, fall leaves placed in <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/photogallery/thanksgiving-table-settings#slide_19">hurricanes</a>.  Very easy, very modern.  Or just go rummage through the produce section and buy <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/photogallery/fall-centerpieces">everything orange</a> you see in sight&#8211;also another super fun idea.  We never carved our pumpkin at Halloween, so we could definitely gut it and put some flowers in there&#8230;  It doesn&#8217;t take much to pretty things up!  What are you doing on your table this year?</p>
