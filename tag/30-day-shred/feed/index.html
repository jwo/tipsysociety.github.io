Every time I start out pumped to no end, only to have the very same outcome of membership cancellation. About 2 years ago I realized that I am just not a gym person, as I signed the cancellation documents of my latest gym member failure.  Here are the ways that I stay in shape WITHOUT a gym.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NFNFN0/?tag=weea-20">Jillian Michaels Banish Fat Boost Metabolism</a> is the hardest of the Jillian videos. Your thighs will hate you, but they may thank you later when they are looking oh so fine.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NFNFMQ/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Jillan Michaels No More Trouble Zones</a> is great circuit training. There are many 7 minute circuits that you can choose from to highlight different areas that you want to work on or you could do the entire workout all at once if you are some kind of badass.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00127RAJY/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Jillian Michaels 30 day Shred </a>is one of the best sculpting workouts that I have found. I never lost any pounds on this workout, but the improvements that I saw in my overall tone and fitness were outstanding. And did I mention it&#8217;s only 20 minutes long. Anyone can find 20 minutes to workout.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000TG8D6I/?tag=weea-20">P90X DVDs</a> is an out of this world workout for the entire body. BUT you may not be able to just jump right into this one. I feel that it is more of a challenge than all of the others that I will list below, but totally worth it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JZ4TPI/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Turbo Jam: Punch Kick and Jam</a> is a longer workout, at 45 mins, but it is great on one of those days where you just want to punch kick and jam someone&#8217;s face off.</li>
