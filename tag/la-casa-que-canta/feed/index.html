		<description><![CDATA[<p>The hubby and I haven&#8217;t gone on a vacation in a couple of years and so we are pining away for another.  Pre-baby we went on a Mexican vacation every year for our anniversary. <a href="http://lacasaquecanta.com/">La Casa Que Canta</a> is where we went for our first annivesary and I have to tell you that it was SO awesome that we both totally want to go back again.  Our room had an outdoor patio with a private infinity pool and a hammock.  DIVINE I tell you.  I was so <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">tipsy</span> relaxed at this place that I literally fell down getting out of that infinity pool AND lost my camera 2 inches from me at the restaurant (in the hotel) that our waiter found quite quickly.  The top pic is the view from the pool on our patio and the bottom pic was our view from the restaurant.  I want to be there NOW.  And just because I want to torture myself, I&#8217;m going to be showing you some of the other places in Mexico we&#8217;ve been on our annual trips in some upcoming posts.</p>
