		<description><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m typically an organized person, but I feel like, here lately, I&#8217;ve been living in organized chaos. So, I&#8217;m officially on a mission to get every closet, drawer, and cabinet in tip-top-shape over the next few months. Here are some recent finds that are helping me with my mission.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Container Store, <a href="http://www.containerstore.com/shop/closet/cubesBins?productId=10020375" target="_blank">Feathergrain Bins</a>: Bins, any bin, are great for those odds and ends that you really don&#8217;t have a place for. They can be stored under any table, or anything for that matter, to chicly disguise your clutter.</li>
<li>OXO, <a href="http://www.oxo.com/OA_HTML/xxoxo_ibeCCtpOXOPrdDtl.jsp?section=10764&amp;item=82294&amp;minisite=10024&amp;respid=53057" target="_blank">POP Containers</a>: These are really great for your pantry because they allow you to see just how much of each food item you have left, which, if you&#8217;re like me, it&#8217;s a necessity. Example: I always buy pasta at the store because I&#8217;m never sure how much I have; then, I get home and I have always have bazillion pounds of it stashed away!</li>
<li>The Container Store, <a href="http://www.containerstore.com/shop/closet/storageBoxes?productId=10024310" target="_blank">Storage Boxes</a>: These pretty boxes are inexpensive, yet, they look so pretty holding all the clutter that I have in my closets&#8230;</li>
<li>The Container Store, <a href="http://www.containerstore.com/shop/office/fileStorage/portable?productId=10027114" target="_blank">Portable File Boxes</a>: I buy a new one of these every year to hold all my bills, essential paper work, tax info, etc, and when the year is over, I neatly put it away for easy access should I need any of that information in the future. It&#8217;s a lot easier than having bulky filing cabinets everywhere.</li>
<li>The Container Store, <a href="http://www.containerstore.com/shop/closet/underbedStorage?productId=10012690" target="_blank">Underbed Boxes</a>: Why let all that space under your bed go unused?</li>
<li>The Container Store, <a href="http://www.containerstore.com/shop/bath/shelving?productId=10016271" target="_blank">Cube Storage</a>: Super-cute alternatives to shelves!</li>
<li>Rubbermaid, <a href="http://www.rubbermaid.com/Category/Pages/SubCategoryLanding.aspx?SpaceId=Closet(RubbermaidSpaces)&amp;SubcatId=CleverStore&amp;CatName=Storage" target="_blank">Clever Store</a>: I&#8217;m a sucker for a Rubbermaid product, and what I like about these is that they&#8217;re clear&#8230;aka, you don&#8217;t have to open the box to see what&#8217;s inside!</li>
<li>The Container Store, <a href="http://www.containerstore.com/shop/bath/cabinetUndersinkStorage/drawersPullOutTrays?productId=10014873" target="_blank">2-drawer Organizer</a>: Great for under the sink in your bathroom where you can always use another drawer.</li>
</ol>
<p>What are your organizing tricks or tips?</p>
