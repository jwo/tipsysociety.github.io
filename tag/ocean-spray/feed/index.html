		<description><![CDATA[<p>I have yet to try this drink, but I thought I would share it with y&#8217;all since it shares my name ðŸ™‚ Doesn&#8217;t it sound like it should involve a lounge chair, a pool, and the sun&#8230; and maybe even a paper umbrella? I canÂ foresee all of these things in my future&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>1 1/2 oz.Â Rum, coconut</li>
<li>1 1/2 oz.Â Vodka, vanilla</li>
<li>1 splashÂ Cranberry Juice</li>
<li>1 partÂ Orange Juice</li>
<li>1 partÂ Pineapple Juice</li>
<li>1 wedgeÂ Lime</li>
</ul>
<p>Add rum and vodka to a hurricane glass full of ice. Fill with desired amount of pineapple and orange juice, topping with a splash of cranberry. Squeeze a lime wedge over it and then drop it in. Enjoy!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I consider this the home stretch of planning all the get togethers and meals surrounding the holiday season. Â This is sure to be a crowd pleaser, looks its takes a bit of prep, but could really pay off!</p>
<ul>
<li>1.5 liters Ocean Spray raspberry cranberry, well chilled</li>
<li>2 Â bottles of sparkling wine, well chilled</li>
<li>1/2 cup Cointreau</li>
<li>2 limes, quartered</li>
<li>1 cup strawberries, washed, halved</li>
<li>3/4 cup blueberries</li>
<li>1/2 cup raspberries</li>
<li>1/4 cup fresh mint leaves</li>
</ul>
<p>Pour the cranberry juice, sparkling wine and Cointreau into a punch bowl. Use your hands to squeeze some of the juice from the limes into the punch. Stir. Add the squeezed limes to the punch. Add the strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and mint leaves. Dunzo.</p>
<p>Some of the other tipsy gals have really cool pitchers to serve this out of, like the ones shown <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/11/hostest-with-the-mostest/" target="_blank">here</a>, I think it would be a shoe-in to a berry merry Christmas!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>We have our first The Tipsy Wedding Project update for you!! Â We begin in pure Tipsy fashion with the drink that Christen chose. Â If you&#8217;ll <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/05/hump-day-happy-hour-meets-the-tipsy-wedding-project/">recall</a> we gave our suggestions and then asked for yours.</p>
<p>Christen and Ed picked a madras to serve to their guests and decided to name it after one of the ideas our commenters threw at them, the &#8220;Fall in Love&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Madras</strong><br />
1 oz orange juice<br />
1.5 oz vodka<br />
3 oz cranberry<br />
garnish with an orange slice!</p>
<p>(served on the rocks in a cocktail glass)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the backstory Christen gave us on the drink decision:</p>
<blockquote><p>We started playing around with some of the recipes provided by you Tipsy gals, which was really fun, as you can imagine!Â  We&#8217;d mix up ingredients and try different combos, but never really hit on a clear choice.Â  Then I rememered how much I like the madras.Â  So I mixed one up for me, one for Ed and he agreed it was tasty!Â  We didn&#8217;t want something too girly-pink or too hardcore (like a martini) and this was a good medium.Â  The color was fun, we could easily garnish with an orange slice, and it was easy enough for the bartender to make in batches and serve up.Â  Winner!</p></blockquote>
