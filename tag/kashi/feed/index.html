		<description><![CDATA[<p>Cereal! It&#8217;s what&#8217;s for breakfast! ha! After doing our little Tipsy fav roundup, it seems us Tipsy gals are either Special K peeps or Kashi peeps.  What do you eat for breakfast?</p>
<ol>
<li>AK-<a href="http://www.specialk.com/cereals/protein-plus">Special K Protein Plus</a>-I am definitely the kind of person that could eat the same thing everyday for breakfast.  I got a recommendation for this cereal by a nutritionist because it has a good balance of carbs and protein and I&#8217;ve been stuck on it ever since!</li>
<li>Court-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002ELLYUI/?tag=weea-20">Kashi Organic Promise Strawberry Fields</a>-This is my absolute FAV.  I love almost all Kashi brands, they really help you get your fiber on.  The only thing about this one, its kind of hard to find.  Costco is generally good to us when it comes to this brand though.</li>
<li>Sarah-<a href="http://www.kashi.com/products/kashi_whole_wheat_biscuits_autumn_wheat">Kashi Organic Promise Autumn Wheat</a>-I just started eating this a few months ago and man I&#8217;m hooked! Not only is it super-healthy for you, but it also has just a slight sweetness that is perfect to start your day.</li>
<li>Der-<a href="http://www.specialk.com/cereals/cinnamon-pecan/">Special K Cinnamon Pecan</a>-Special K Cinnamon Pecan is by far the best cereal I have ever eaten in my entire life. Let me also let you know that I don&#8217;t eat cereal with milk. I don&#8217;t drink milk or even like it in my cereal. So, for me cereal is more of a snack food than a breakfast food. Anywho, this is like a drug to me and I go through at least one box per week. Good thing it&#8217;s low cal or I&#8217;d be in big trouble.</li>
