		<description><![CDATA[<p>As you know, Court and I are <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/03/confessions-of-tipsy-girls/">Twi-hards</a>.  I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily call us fanatics or anything, we are just fans.  Der is too, although she hasn&#8217;t read any of the series, her sister has just told her all the details from the book and then she watched the movies.  Court and I have tried to get Der to read the books and granted, she started the first one but I don&#8217;t think she ever finished it.  Meaning I think she may have gotten to page 5 and then her sister was just basically her Cliff&#8217;s Notes. So I think that makes Der a Twi-Semi Hard (no pun intended).</p>
<p>So anyway, back to the subject at hand.  Eclipse.  It&#8217;s coming out next week.  My husband has so graciously decided to take off work and take me to the 10a showing because it comes out on my birthday.  What a present eh?  And before you say anything, I&#8217;m going to just go ahead and out my husband because he has also read all of the books and watched the movies and I&#8217;m not sure if he&#8217;s going to kill me for saying that, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to be a hardship for him to watch the movie with me, if you get my drift.</p>
<p>I was seriously tempted to do the whole Twilight she-bang at our theater the night before where they show Twilight, New Moon and then a midnight showing of Eclipse&#8230;but let&#8217;s be honest here&#8230;I&#8217;d still have to get up at 6:30a with the kiddo and I honestly don&#8217;t know if I could stay up that late.  Pathetic, I know.  So I would like to know who of you are Twi-hards and are you going to see the movie when it comes out?</p>
