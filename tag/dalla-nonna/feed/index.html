		<description><![CDATA[<p>So my hubby bought this necklace for me for Mother&#8217;s Day this year.  My calendar necklace from <a href="http://dallanonnajewelry.com/index.php?main_page=index">dalla nonna</a> is the month of October and has my son&#8217;s birthday along with my wedding anniversary because they happened the same month 3 years apart!  FTW!</p>
<p>Girls, drop the hint&#8211;its a super elegantly simple everyday necklace that your guy should totally buy you for an anniversary or your wedding or your first child.  And guys (if any guys read this site) that means&#8211;if you are getting married, already are married or if your wife birthed your child from her very own loins either after hours and hours of painstaking labor or via scalpel because of a c-section, then you totally owe her.</p>
<p>And DUDE, they totally have bracelets now!</p>
