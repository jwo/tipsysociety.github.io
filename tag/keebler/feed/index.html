		<description><![CDATA[<p>I am not generally a chocolate person. I don&#8217;t like chocolate ice cream, chocolate pudding, chocolate cake, or plain chocolate candy (gotta have some nuts or something in it ðŸ™‚ ) But I LOVE brownies. If you put a pan of brownies in front of me, I guarantee you I will eat <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the whole pan</span> more than one. Needless to say I don&#8217;t get brownies often. But I have discovered the answer to my chocolate prayers.Â  I found <a href="http://keebler.com/#/cookies/product/detail/">these</a> at my local HEB (grocery store here in Texas) and they solve my dilemma quite nicely. Real brownie pieces in a 100 calorie pouch. Just enough to quiet my craving but not enough to expand my waistline.Â  Not to mention they taste soooo good&#8230;</p>
