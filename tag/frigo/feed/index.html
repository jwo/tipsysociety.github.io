		<description><![CDATA[<p>My now husband proposed to me in late 2007 after having dated for over 6 years. Imagine how THRILLED I was to finally get that rock on my finger! Then I saw a pic of me + 6 chins from the night of our engagement&#8230; thrill <em>over</em>, well sorta.  Good news: Fiance loves me and all my chins. Bad news: I have GOT to get rid of this shit before I walk down that aisle!  Over the next 6 months, I lost about 50 pounds.  Here were my staple weightloss foods for those of you who are looking to lose a couple chins yourselves.</p>

<ol>
<li>Smart Ones Baked Ziti-The perfect lunch. The cheese ratio is ultra high, so this is a cheese lover&#8217;s delight.</li>
<li>Nature&#8217;s Own Wheat Light-Toast, sammiches, you name it&#8230; 40 calories a slice and good.</li>
<li>HoneyCrisp Apples-As sweet as candy, but not candy and therefore a good choice.</li>
<li>McDonald&#8217;s Ice Cream Cone-150 calories is a small price to pay for the deliciousness that is this treat. I am decently sure that I drained majority of my local Mickey D&#8217;s of all ice cream inventory during 2008.</li>
<li>Frigo Cheese Head Light String Cheese-50% less fat than other cheese and still cheese, so perfect.</li>
</ol>
