<p>So friends, should I take my activity center back and get a bouncer? What will the baby like/use more do you think?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m the type of person that has to constantly change up my workout routine because, well lets be honest, I get BORED! Some of the workouts I tried and loved in 2010 include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bootcamp; by far my favorite workout of the year because everyday is something different!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NFNFMQ/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">No More Trouble Zones</a>; this was a good &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel like going to the gym&#8221; workout.</li>
<li>Reformer Pilates; Not a huge cardio workout, but GREAT for strength training.</li>
<li>Bickram Yoga; I only did this a couple of times because it was so dang TOUGH, but I think this should be my go to in 2011 to help sweat off the baby weight.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, I put a question mark next to the title of this post because I&#8217;m interested to see if there&#8217;s a new workout that I need to know about and/or try!?!?!? It seems that every year there&#8217;s a huge fad, and I&#8217;m not above jumping on a bandwagon&#8230;</p>

Although we&#8217;re not Jewish, my Aunt likes everyday things that are a little off the beaten path, and the Hebrew language is rooted in so many facets of our culture&#8230;so if anyone of your list is a) hard to buy for and b) remotely spiritual, these could be the perfect gift!</p>
