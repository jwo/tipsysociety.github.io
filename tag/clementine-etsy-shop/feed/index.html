		<description><![CDATA[<p>Currently my everyday necklace is a gold rectangle bar with my sons&#8217; initials on a silver chain.  I&#8217;ve been quite partial to mixing the gold and silver lately.  So when I saw these necklaces on <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/ShopClementine?ref=seller_info">Clementine</a> etsy shop, I immediately fell in love and also think it would perfectly compliment what I already wear&#8230;just another layer.  We all need layers right?  Personally I think I&#8217;d get the gold chain/silver bar combo since my other necklace is the opposite combination.</p>
