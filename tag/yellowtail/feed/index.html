		<description><![CDATA[<p>So for my first post, I decided to make it all about one of my loves: WINE! Now yes, I did say just one of my loves, and I will get to the rest of them eventually, but you can read more about me <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/sarah/" target="_blank">here</a> for now.</p>
<p>I will say that I was always intimidated by wine, that is, until I went to the FABULOUS Napa Valley region for my honeymoon, circa 2007. One may say that going to Napa would only confuse or even intimidate you more; however, my experience was the exact opposite.</p>
<p>My husband and I had a fabulous driver for a day, Tac Fair the owner and operator of <a href="http://www.napatac.com/index.html" target="_blank">Napa Tac </a>Tours and Chauffeur, and he gave us one piece of advice that I have never forgotten. Tac told us at the very beginning of the day, &#8220;You guys are going to hear that you <em>should</em> love this wine because it&#8217;s expensive or you <em>should</em> love this wine because it has won so many awards, but the bottom line is that you ARE going to like what you like&#8230;so go with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I love Tac for this reason, and I&#8217;m passing along the same advice. Below are a few brands and types of wine that you will ALWAYS be able to find in my house. Some are really cheap, some are more on the pricey side, but all, in my opinion, are GREAT!!!!</p>
