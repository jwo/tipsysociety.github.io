		<description><![CDATA[<p>As my fellow Tipsy buds, <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2009/11/5-hair-saviors/">Der</a> and <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2009/10/crazy-hair/">Court</a> have posted about their tried and true hair products, it got me thinking about how the four of us have such different hair and the challenges that we face living in this humidity pit we live in.  My hair=thick, unruly, ALOT, thick..did I say thick?  Good Lord I have a lot of hair on this head of mine.</p>
<p>Here is the stuff I&#8217;m currently using&#8230;I say currently because I think I&#8217;m a closeted hair product addict&#8211;I like to pretend I don&#8217;t need a lot of hair product assistance when in actuality I do.  And my hair gets used to certain products after a while, so I have to change it up from time to time.  This is what is currently working for me&#8230;I&#8217;ll keep you posted when I change it up.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KQDXNK/?tag=weea-20">Pureology Super Straight Shampoo</a>-LOVE the smell of this.  Like LOVE love.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=prod270002">Original Crema Ultra Moisturizing Conditioner by Terax</a>-I originally heard about this from the great <a href="http://whoorl.com/">Whoorl</a>/<a href="http://www.hairthursday.com/">Hair Thursday</a> and while I was a little skeptical when I realized the consistency of it was THICK, man o man do I love this conditioner!  It&#8217;s done wonders for my hair and it detangles like nobody&#8217;s business.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000RERYGW/?tag=weea-20">Pureology Serious Colour Care Superstraight Serum</a>-they call this a &#8220;serum&#8221; but when I think serum I think sorta liquidy, its not, its a gel.  My wavy/unruly hair needs some sort of gel type product when I blow dry it and this is what I&#8217;m currently loving.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000ZFGCYS/?tag=weea-20">Pureology Antifade Complex Super Smooth Hot Iron Protection</a>-I use this after my hair has been dried and before I flat iron it.  I&#8217;ve tried just spraying it all over and then flat ironing and I&#8217;ve also tried spraying as I go with the flat iron.  My hair seems to do better with the later.  I&#8217;ve read some reviews where people have said it leaves their hair sticky and crunchy or something, but I haven&#8217;t had this experience.  It leaves my hair really soft and shiny and it almost seems easier to get my hair straight with this stuff.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000LAB3QE/?tag=weea-20">Redken 03 Water Wax Shine Defining Pomade</a>-I use this after I&#8217;m done with the flat iron&#8230;I get a little bit on my fingers and just kinda run my fingers from underneath all over my hair and then tame the crazy hairs around my face.  I also morph my bangs in the direction I want them to go and it seems to stay pretty well with this stuff.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod620032">Moisture Barrier Firm Hold Hair Spray Frizz Ease by John Frieda</a>-I don&#8217;t always use hair spray but if the weather is particularly wet out or the humidity is like a wall of hot steam when I walk outside, I spray a little of this all over.  My trick is that I lightly spray it, let it dry and then carefully brush it out.  It leaves just enough hold but my hair still moves.</li>
</ol>
<p>So there you have it, those are my current tricks for taming this head of hair.  Some days the products win, and other days the humidity wins.  I bet you anything, the minute I post this info the humidity will win.</p>

<p>John Freida pretty much invented products for trying to tame our beasts, but these latest few products leave my mop lookin&#8217; real nice!  Soft, but not frizzy.  Defined, but not crunchy.</p>
<p>Here they are in order of when I use them&#8230;</p>
<ol>
<li> <a title="Shampoo" href="http://www.johnfrieda.com/products/product_detail.asp?productLine=frizz_ease&amp;pid=86" target="_blank">FRIZZ-EASE Curl Around Style Starting Daily Shampoo</a></li>

</ol>
<p>The best thing about this line is the price tag.  All four can be purchased for a total of around <strong><em>20 dollars</em></strong> at your local CVS, Walgreen&#8217;s, or grocery store.</p>
