		<description><![CDATA[<p>One of the girls that regularly attends <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2009/11/6-steps-to-a-successful-keno-par-tay/">Keno</a> with us made these for Keno a while back and I couldn&#8217;t get enough of these in my belly.  So I made these for the adults at my son&#8217;s birthday party.  You can&#8217;t go wrong with these, I promise and they take next to no time to make.</p>
<p><strong>Tortilla Rollups</strong><br />
8 ounces cream cheese, softened<br />
16 ounces sour cream<br />
1 package taco seasoning<br />
2 cups cheddar cheese, shredded<br />
8 10-inch flour tortillas</p>
<p>Combine cream cheese, sour cream, taco seasoning and cheese.  Spread on the flour tortillas and roll them up.  Cut 1 inch pieces.  You can serve this with salsa, but man I could eat a thousand of them without.</p>
