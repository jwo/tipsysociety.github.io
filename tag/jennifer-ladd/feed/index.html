		<description><![CDATA[<p>I ran across <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop.php?user_id=5397355">Jennifer Ladd&#8217;s Etsy shop</a> when I was looking for gifts to give all the girls that threw me a baby shower way back when I was a waddling fool.  I can&#8217;t tell you how much I drooled over all the different fabrics.  So many different colors and patterns.  I would like one of each please.  You can never have too many &#8220;going out&#8221; purses, can you? Don&#8217;t answer that.  Have a gander at all her past and present items&#8230;tons of cuteness!</p>
