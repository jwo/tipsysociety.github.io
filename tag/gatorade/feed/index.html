		<description><![CDATA[<p>March Madness began last week.  For those of you who don&#8217;t know, it is the huge NCAA college basketball tournament. I happened to be in Las Vegas when it began, and let me tell you, those people were definitely on something. Was it crack, or just a shit ton of alcohol, we will never know. What I do know is that it was crazy. Now, I am not a big basketball fan, but this year Houston is the lucky host of the Final Four so I thought I should celebrate that with a cocktail (even though my team lost in the first round&#8230;).</p>
<p>1 oz Peach Schnapps<br />
1 oz Triple Sec<br />
1 1/2 oz Vodka<br />
4 oz  Monster Energy Drink<br />
3 oz Orange Gatorade</p>
<p>Mix it all together and serve in a highball glass.</p>
<p>* The recipe actually calls for Amp energy drink but I personally think it is disgusting so I changed it to Monster. If you are anti-energy drink, I imagine this drink would taste good without that ingredient, although you may want to add some soda so its not too strong&#8230;</p>
