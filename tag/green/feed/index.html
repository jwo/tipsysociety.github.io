		<description><![CDATA[<p>They are comfortable and cute and did I mention&#8230;they are earth friendly, vegan, natural, made with organic cotton, hemp, recycled inner tubes and recycled tires?</p>
<p>I found the CUTEST, most comfortable flats in the <a title="Simple Shoes Sale" href="http://www.simpleshoes.com/ClearanceList.aspx?g=w&amp;categoryID=221" target="_blank">sale</a> section of <a href="http://www.simpleshoes.com/index.aspx">Simple</a>, for under $15!  They offer free shipping, great shoes, and an even better message:</p>
<blockquote><p>HOW we make our shoes is just as important as WHY we make them. That means finding more sustainable ways of doing business so we can make a gazillion more.<br />
Which pretty much is where we are today&#8230; at the crossroads of here and now, aware of our responsibility to the planet while trying to pay the bills. The nice little shoe company getting in touch with its inner hippie.</p></blockquote>
<p>All the great things are simple!</p>
