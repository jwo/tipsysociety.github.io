		<description><![CDATA[<p>Dudes, I have to confess something. I once swore I would never ever put a pair of Toms on my feet. When my hipster, walks to the beat of his own drum brother began wearing then several years ago&#8230; I thought they were the UGLIEST things I ever laid eyes on and no way would I ever place those colored ace bandages on my feet.</p>
<p>Present day:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7078" title="der-sorry tom2" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/der-sorry-tom2.png" alt="" width="500" height="502" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/der-sorry-tom2.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/der-sorry-tom2-150x150.png 150w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/der-sorry-tom2-298x300.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>Yep. Those are my feet. Dressed in the most comfortable shoes to ever wrap around them. I don&#8217;t often fork out a lot of money like $45 for a pair of shoes, but this time I did (because it was Christmas money) and I don&#8217;t regret it.</p>
<p>BUT&#8230;like every time I buy something full price, I turn right around and find an almost identical knock off for half price. Here we are. Again.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Everybody and their mom has heard of Toms. They pretty much are the most comfortable shoes ever, even if they are not always the most attractive (some of them look like ace bandages wrapped around your feet). I was browsing the website recently and I came across <a href="http://www.toms.com/cranberry-canvas-women-s-wedges">these</a>&#8230; I could not believe my eyes! Toms makes wedges now!! I can only imagine how comfortable these are.  Now I know they are a little pricey, but remember that for every pair you buy, the company will donate a pair to a child in need.  So really you are buying 2 pairs, plus you get to do a good deed while shopping 🙂</p>
