		<description><![CDATA[<p>Here are a few ideas for stocking stuffers of the girly kind ala ak!  I think this is the perfect combo of girly meets geeky meets OCD if I do say so myself.  Can I get a WHAT WHAT?!</p>
<ol>
<li>Levenger, <a href="http://www.levenger.com/PAGETEMPLATES/PRODUCT/Product.asp?Params=Category=15-102|Level=2-3|PageID=7230">Pocquettes Zipped Earbud Pouch Keychain</a> &#8211; This is SO cool, I mean the little thing that fits inside to keep the earbuds from tangling up&#8211;can you say OCD much?</li>
<li>Bagel Creations Etsy Shop, <a href="http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?listing_id=30913977">Adjustable Coffee Cozy-Bright</a> &#8211; I purchased one of these a while back for a <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2009/11/6-steps-to-a-successful-keno-par-tay/">keno</a> gift and also bought one for myself and they are awesome and very chic!</li>

<li>Anne Taintor, <a href="http://annetaintor.com/allproducts.html?sub=Magnets&amp;id=01359">She Was One Cocktail Away From Proving His Mother Right Magnet</a> &#8211; I can&#8217;t tell you how funny I think this is as well as everything on this site.</li>
