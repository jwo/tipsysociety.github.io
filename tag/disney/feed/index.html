		<description><![CDATA[<p>On a whim, while I was browsing Barnes &amp; Noble* a few weeks back, I ran across these Sesame Street board books as a set called My First Library.  They were a HIT at my household.  Somebody who will remain nameless ran around our house yelling COOKIE! COOKIE! EGGO! OSSER!  So the other day I was in B&amp;N again and as I was walking out I saw they had a whole crapload of these My First Library sets in all sorts of themes.  And guess who is kicking herself for not buying the Toy Story one.  Stupid Stupid Stupid.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>So my child wakes up at 6a most days, takes 1 nap that can range anywhere from 15 minutes to 2 hours depending on the day, and the rest of the time? The rest of the time involves running, lots and lots of running and/or thinking the furniture in our house is the <a href="http://littlegym.com/">Little Gym</a>.  Generally the only time the kiddo will sit still is if I put on Toy Story 1 or 2.  And I&#8217;m gonna go ahead and admit it, it&#8217;s really nice to sit down for a breather.  So we are very much looking forward to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0435761/">Toy Story 3</a> coming out and having that be The First Movie Experience.</p>
<p>So with all that said, I have two questions for you:</p>
<p>What is your kiddo&#8217;s favorite movie?</p>
<p>And why does Bullseye (horse) not speak when Hamm (pig), Rex (dinosaur), and Slinky (dog) do?</p>
