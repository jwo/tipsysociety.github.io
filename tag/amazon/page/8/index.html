			<div class="entry-content"><p>Are you the type that buys your Halloween early to get the best selection and then you end up eating most of it yourself and have to go buy more to actually hand out to the kids?  Yeah we are too.  These are our favorite Halloween candies, or just what we want to be eating right here right now!</p>
<ol>
<li>Melis-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041P82BO/?tag=weea-20">Brach&#8217;s Mellocreme Pumpkin</a>-I love these things. Yes, they are pretty much just sugar and food coloring in the shape of a pumpkin but for some reason my tastebuds cannot get enough. Its probably a good thing they aren&#8217;t available year round.</li>
<li>AK-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000IK8TSC/?tag=weea-20">Jelly Belly Sour Cherry Jelly Beans</a>-I honestly don&#8217;t have a specific halloween candy so much as just a favorite candy genre.  That genre would include anything that is sour.  And last week I read a tweet about jelly beans and haven&#8217;t been able to stop thinking about these.</li>
<li>Sarah-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003BS2U6A/?tag=weea-20">Caramel Apple Tootsie Pops</a>-I was introduced to these suckers in high school, or maybe junior high&#8230;anyway, LOVE them (and the funny thing is that I hate real candied apples, and apples in general)&#8230;these bad boys are only available at Halloween, so every year I have to stock up!</li>
<li>Court-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FAUMWG/?tag=weea-20">Runts</a>-Man I love these.  However; PICK OUT THE BANANAS and put all the apples in my belly.</li>
</ol>
<p>What is going in your belly this Halloween?</p>

<div class="post-info"><span class="date published time" title="2010-10-26T06:00:51+00:00">October 26, 2010</span>  by <span class="author vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="../../../../author/ak/index.html" rel="author">ak</a></span></span>  </div>			<div class="thesis_post_image">

			</div>
			<div class="entry-content"><p>I was having a conversation with a friend of mine the other day about scary movies.  He said he&#8217;d seen the newest exorcist movie and he didn&#8217;t think it was that scary.  He proceeded to tell me the plot and it sounded pretty damn scary to me! So I asked him, what kind of movie scares him? He explained the kind of movie that scared him and it seem like maybe his ultimate scary movie is like science experiment horror.</p>
<p>So that got me thinking&#8230;what do I think is scary?  I think a big thing for me is if something is based on a true story then it definitely scares the crap out of me.  These movies have scared the crap out of me through the years.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/079073804X/?tag=weea-20">The Exorcist</a>-I&#8217;m pretty sure this is based on a true story&#8230;this to me is the ultimate scary movie.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000C8ART/?tag=weea-20">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a>-This too is based on a true story.  I live in Texas.  And I still haven&#8217;t been able to make it through the entire movie.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JQTT/?tag=weea-20">A Nightmare on Elm Street</a>-I know this isn&#8217;t based on a true story but Freddie was a child murderer that is coming back to avenge his death.  And I also am very creeped out by that song in the movie&#8230;One, two Freddie&#8217;s comin for you&#8230;.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00009UW0N/?tag=weea-20">Halloween</a>-This could totally be a true story.  Dude kills his sister, goes into an insane asylum and then escapes and starts killing people.  Amirite?  Side note: did you know the mask that Michael the killer wears in this film was created from William Shatner&#8217;s face?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005JLTK/?tag=weea-20">The Ring</a>-Just the girl crawling out of the tv gets me every time.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000V4UFZK/?tag=weea-20">Poltergeist</a>-I think I&#8217;ve seen this one the most out of all of these.  The house built on a cemetary&#8230;hearing Carol Anne via the television&#8230;DON&#8217;T GO INTO THE LIGHT!  And finally the fact that a lot of these people that acted in this movie are now dead is creepy to me&#8230;a Poltergeist curse!</li>
</ol>
<p>So what is your genre of scary movie?</p>

<p>Enter our latest distraction, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000SONEQA/?tag=weea-20">Melissa &amp; Doug Bead Maze</a>!  The best part of this toy is that it has suction cups on the bottom.  I know some places this won&#8217;t work, but the places we frequent the most, it does.  So I thought I&#8217;d share what has been working for us lately.  Also, this ranges in age from 12months to 4 YEARS.  That&#8217;s almost crazy insane.</p>

Those of you having no clue who this Naruto guy is, have an 8 year old boy and you&#8217;ll figure it out real quick.  So no store carries the costumes, so we test our luck ordering online.</p>

			<div class="entry-content"><p>We all have them, you know, that one song that you absolutely HAVE to listen to when you&#8217;re on a road trip.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s our road trip songs, what are yours?</p>
<ol>
<li>AK, Pat Green &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000V66OM6/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Carry On</a>&#8220;: Oldie but goodie&#8230;my favorite line is &#8220;Billboards and Bullshit got her down&#8221;.  It&#8217;s one of those roll the windows down and blare it kinda songs.  Hopefully it&#8217;s sunny out.</li>
<li>Sarah, O.A.R &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00260US9A/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">That Was a Crazy Game of Poker</a>&#8220;: I CAN NOT get enough of this song and it&#8217;s perfect for road trips because it&#8217;s almost 9 minutes long! So basically, by the time you listen to it a few times (you know, to figure out all the words), you&#8217;re probably at least half way to your destination.</li>
<li>Melis, Hank Williams Jr. &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001D5IMC4/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Bartender Song</a>&#8220;: During one of my many years spent in college, a group of friends and I decided to take a road trip to Colorado. For some reason we listened to this song almost once an hour on that 20 hour drive, don&#8217;t ask me why. But now when I think road trip this song always comes to mind&#8230;</li>
<li>Court, Explosions in the Sky &#8220;<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/your-hand-in-mine/id318951781?i=318951791" target="_blank">Your Hand in Mine</a>&#8220;: This is actually not a roll your windows down sing along.  Its all instrumental and has lots of highs and lows.  Pretty EMO song, but I love it.  Ben introduced me to this band and it&#8217;s since been one of my favs.  I think I love listening to this song because its 9 damn minutes long and its great to listen to while reading or riding along.</li>

			<div class="entry-content"><p>Last week Susan at The Working Closet did a post entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/workingcloset/2010/10/13/five-things-i-never-leave-home-without/">5 Things I Never Leave Home Without</a>&#8220;.  These are things that no matter where she&#8217;s going she never leaves home without them.  So it got me thinking&#8230;what would that be for me?  Some of the things she had on her list were on my list but some were also different.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3020908?origin=PredictiveSearch&amp;resultback=100">Hobo International Lauren Wallet</a>-I think this is probably a given for most people but no matter what I am taking this with me because it houses a lot of the items below.  Mine isn&#8217;t yellow, it&#8217;s turquoise but alas I could not find that picture to show you.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/templates/products/spp/index.tmpl?CATEGORY_ID=CATEGORY22745&amp;PRODUCT_ID=PROD1112">Bobbi Brown Cosmetics Lip Color in Slopes</a>-I come from a long line of ladies that without a doubt never go out without lipstick on.  Even my grandma at 88 would always have her lipstick on at all times.  We seem a little crazy don&#8217;t we?  We aren&#8217;t, I promise&#8230;we only have a slight case of the crazies.  So anyway, this is my fall/winter color that I wear.  I get sorta attached to lipshades and tend to stick with one color for a long long time.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">My iPhone</a>-Because I will never forget the time when I ran out of gas and didn&#8217;t have my cell phone with me and I had to ask the person in the car next to me if I could use their cell to call my husband.  Awful, on so many levels.  At this point, with an iPhone it is also a great toddler distractor as well.</li>
<li><a href="http://patemm.com/">Patemm Pad</a>-Because I have a toddler, I can&#8217;t ever leave home without diaper equipment.  This changing pad is the best changing pad ever and I&#8217;ve told you about it <a href="../../../../2009/11/the-best-changing-pad-ever/index.html">before</a>. I love that this pad can also hold my diapers and wipes and has a handle for carrying.  The best part about this changing pad is that its round and no matter where your kiddo is flailing, the changing pad will generally guard them from the scariness that is public restrooms.  My particular style of Patemm is called the &#8220;Deke&#8221; which I don&#8217;t think they make anymore, but you can definitely find some cuteness on their site.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001IAG7G2/?tag=weea-20">Aquaphor Lip Balm</a>-I can never put lipstick on without first putting a lip balm on and while I have been a devotee of the L&#8217;Occitane Shea Butter Lip Balm, it&#8217;s just too easy to pick up this Aquaphor Lip Balm at the grocery store or drug store.  It also works well in a mini manicure situation on your cuticles.</li>
</ol>
<p>So tell me, what 5 things do you never leave home without?</p>

That, my friends, is the beauty of a birthday, and mine is right around the corner. Here are some items that are on my birthday wish list this year&#8230;</p>

<li>Reebok,  <a href="http://www.reebok.com/US/product?modelId=30039358&amp;articleId=V49597">RunTone Action Shoes</a> : I just recently started running and I really want a pair of these shoes.  Who doesn&#8217;t want their butt to look better?</li>

			<div class="entry-content"><p>You&#8217;ve heard the old school saying, &#8220;A woman&#8217;s hair is her crowning glory.&#8221; HAHAHAHA&#8230;I&#8217;m not saying that&#8217;s a fact, but I do know that almost all women have their favorite hair &#8220;stuff&#8221;, be it a product or an accessory.</p>
<p>Here are our favs, what are yours?</p>
<ol>
<li>AK, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00284W03Q/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Scunci No-slip Grip Flat Headwraps</a>: I don&#8217;t generally wear hair accessories and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m devoted to a product as much as Melis is but I do have one hair item that I wear without a doubt during all my workouts and it&#8217;s this no slip grip headband. I can&#8217;t stand to have hair in my eyes when I&#8217;m working out and these babies definitely do the trick and stay put!</li>
<li>Melis, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001235I24/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Biolage by Matrix Hydro-Foaming Styler</a>: I use hair mouse EVERY SINGLE DAY. If I don&#8217;t, my hair sticks to my head and I look bald. Trust me, It&#8217;s not a pretty sight. I can&#8217;t even put my hair in a ponytail without mouse, its that bad. I have used many different volumizing mouses in my life, and this is by far my favorite. It gives a lot of volume but it doesn&#8217;t make my hair stiff. Not to mention it smells A-mazing.</li>
<li>Sarah, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NEPX3E/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Goody Ouchless Elastics</a>: I&#8217;m a ponytail girl true and through&#8230;they&#8217;re easy, fast, can be cute, and it gives me an alternative to washing and styling my hair every single day! These are my go-to pony tail holders because they&#8217;re big enough to hold my massive amounts of hair without damaging it.</li>
<li>Court, <a href="http://www.johnfrieda.com/products/product_detail.asp?productLine=frizz_ease&amp;productCategory=8&amp;pid=52" target="_blank">Frizz-Ease Hair Serum</a>: This is the OG of products for me, but its stayed an ol&#8217; faithful for me. I always have a three step process for my curls that begins with a serum and this legend always makes its way in the mix.</li>

			<div class="entry-content"><p>Tipsy Favs this week is highlighting our go-to music&#8230;the album we can always fall back on as an all time fav when we don&#8217;t really have anything else to listen to or the album we listen to with some sort of obsessive compulsive disorder or ALL OF THE ABOVE!</p>
<ol>
<li>Melis-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002NJ8X9G/?tag=weea-20">Glee Soundtrack</a>-I am a self proclaimed GLEEK and you can find me singing along loudly and off key any time I&#8217;m in my vehicle to one of the many Glee soundtracks that I am the proud owner of. I have perfected Defying Gravity, except for that last high note.. gets me every time.</li>
<li>Sarah-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000CE752/?tag=weea-20">George Strait</a>-George Strait is THE MAN&#8230;that&#8217;s all there is to say. His sound hasn&#8217;t changed much (if at all) in the 25+ years I&#8217;ve been listening to him and I love him for that&#8230;this is one of those things that if I had to choose 1 artist, he would be it, and this CD is a good overview of all his greatest hits!</li>
<li>Court-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000AADYRQ/?tag=weea-20">Deathcab for Cutie</a>-I&#8217;m a total emo when it comes to music. This band defines alternative for me. This band also holds a special place in my heart because Ben and I happen to both adore them. Anywhere anytime I&#8217;ll belt out these well written meaningful lyrics.</li>
<li>AK-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006J3UT/?tag=weea-20">Faith Hill</a>-I&#8217;m a huge Faith Hill fan. I have all her albums, I&#8217;ve seen her in concert, etc.  This album specifically got a lot of flack for not being country enough or whatever but I have to say it really came along at a turning point in my life and I listened to &#8220;Stronger&#8221; probably more times than any other song ever.</li>
