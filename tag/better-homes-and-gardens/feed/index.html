<ul>
<li>Place fresh flowers on the bedside table in the guest room.</li>
<li>Have travel bathroom necessities out and ready for your guests to use.</li>
<li>Hang a fresh, clean, robe in the guest room for your guests.</li>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>When I&#8217;m bored, I usually don&#8217;t just pick up a book&#8230;instead, I&#8217;ll head straight to a magazine. (The only problem is that I refuse to pay for any subscriptions, so I have to resort to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">stealing</span> borrowing them from other people&#8230;)</p>
<p>Here are a few of my faves (and where I get them)!</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.texasmonthly.com/" target="_blank">Texas Monthly</a>: From my NeeNee and/or Dad.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bonappetit.com/" target="_blank">Bon Appetit</a>: I actually have a subscription to this, but only because it was a gift from my fabulous Aunt Cindy. So far I am LOVING all the new recipes!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bhg.com/" target="_blank">Better Homes and Gardens</a>: From my MIL (mother in law).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.people.com/people/" target="_blank">People</a>: From EVERYONE (mostly my Mom though)&#8230;I&#8217;m actually a little shocked at how many people I know get subscriptions to People.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.glamour.com/" target="_blank">Glamour</a>: This one is a toughie because it&#8217;s hard to find people, other than my nail salon, that get regular copies; however, if you&#8217;re a subscriber, send your old issues my way&#8230;.we&#8217;ll call it recycling&#8230; ðŸ™‚</li>
</ol>
<p>What are your FAVE magazines? (And, do you prefer to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">steal</span> borrow or buy?)</p>
