		<description><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s starting to get hot and humid here in Houston&#8230;in the 80s for the most part.  And my being pregnant means I feel about 20 degrees hotter than that.  I will be counting down the days until I can have my favorite drink to cool down: The Margarita.</p>
<p>Everyone reading this, please go and have a margarita for me!!  Come summer time I will be able to join you all!!</p>
<p>Fill up the Minute Maid container about 3/4 full with Mr &amp; Mrs T Margarita Mix and add to the blender.  Then fill the container 3/4 full with tequila* and add to the blender as well.  Add ice to the top of the blender container.  Blend and drink. You can pour into a glass or you could just drink it out of the blender pitcher.  Whichever you prefer.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>This is my tried and true Margarita recipe.  It&#8217;s super duper easy.  Get the large Minute Maid Frozen Limeade and squeeze it into the blender.  Fill up the Minute Maid container about 3/4 full with Mr &amp; Mrs T Margarita Mix and add to the blender.  Then fill the container 3/4 full with tequila* and add to the blender as well.  Add ice to the top of the blender container.  Blend and drink. You can pour into a glass or you could just drink it out of the blender pitcher.  Whichever you prefer.</p>
<p>*Centenario Anejo tequila is by far the best tequila my husband and I have encountered.  It&#8217;s definitely our &#8220;good&#8221; tequila that we always have on hand.  You can use whatever kind of tequila you prefer.</p>
