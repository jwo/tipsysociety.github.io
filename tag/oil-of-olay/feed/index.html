		<description><![CDATA[<p>Remember when we talked about these <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/02/tipsy-favs-moisturizers/">moisturizers</a>? I really liked the Aveeno for winter but in the summer wooo man that stuff was a bit THICK.  So I was wanting to try something else that was anti-aging and was talking to my cousin about it and she said that I needed to try this line by Oil of Olay.  That she had been using it and had told everybody in our family about it except me apparently.  I guess she wants me to look all old and wrinkly.  So I bought it and I do really like it.  The moisturizer is light and goes on great under makeup.  The eye cream and night cream, neither of which have ever been on my agenda in terms of skin care, are actually really good.  I haven&#8217;t broken out with either of them, which is generally something I worry about with moisturizer stuff.  And the fragrance is very light, nothing overpowering in the least.  Oh and also, I look 10 years younger after just 2 weeks of using these products.*</p>
<p>*that might be a lie</p>
