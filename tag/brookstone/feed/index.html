		<description><![CDATA[<p>We had a great Christmas! My husband and I think this year has been the best so far in terms of celebrating with our son.  He got excited to hand out gifts and open gifts and play with everything.  It was super fun.  Here are a few things I got for Christmas this year:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.brookstone.com/ultrasonic-jewelry-cleaner-dvd-cleaners.html?his=2%7E46337%7E2%7Eroot_category%40kwd%7Ejewelry&amp;bkiid=searchResults|C4CategoryProdList1FDT|8417281">Jewelry Cleaner</a>, Brookstone-If you&#8217;ve ever thought about getting one of these things, do it! Do it now! All you do is add water and it uses sound waves to clean everything.  I immediately did my wedding ring and watch and embarrassed at the amount of gunk that came off both of them.  And I THOUGHT I kept them clean.  This also does eyeglasses, which I haven&#8217;t done yet but am psyched to do.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.jcrew.com/womens_category/sweaters/cardigans/PRDOVR~29350/29350.jsp">Jackie cardigan</a>, J.Crew-I love these cardigans and buy them at the outlet store or ask for them as gifts.  I&#8217;m a cardigan addict.  I received navy and cerise for Christmas.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.katespade.com/product/index.jsp?productId=4075994&amp;cp=4335762.2065600">iPhone Case</a>, Kate Spade-I was in need of a new case and received one like this and it&#8217;s right up my alley what with all the colors!!</li>
<li><a href="http://store.apple.com/us/personalize/apple?mco=MTc0MjU2MDE&amp;product=MA210">Apple gift card</a>, Apple-In combination with my husband we received enough apple gift cards to purchase an iPad.  However after a twitter questionnaire we&#8217;ve decided to wait on the next version to come out before we buy it.  I think that&#8217;s in April.  I think.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000W8V4WS/?tag=weea-20">iSi Flexible Mixing Bowls</a>, Amazon-A month or so ago, in an effort to do something in the kitchen, I gave my son a couple of mixing bowls and a wooden spoon to occupy him.  That turned into me needing new bowls.  I don&#8217;t think these will break.</li>
</ol>
<p>The best gift of all might be what Santa brought my son.  He loves it more than anything and it gives his parents a chance to sit and chill for a few minutes. <a href="http://www.walmart.com/ip/Little-Star-Bouncer/10172315">Little Star Bouncer</a>, Walmart</p>
