		<description><![CDATA[<p>Hey y&#8217;all! Sorry for the lack of posting! It&#8217;s been a bit nutty around here, hopefully we can get back into a groove here.  I thought I&#8217;d share some new hair stuff I just recently tried. Just to give you an idea&#8230;I have the thickest hair known to man and live in a VERY humid area, so not only does it take me like 500 years to dry my hair straight, then I have to fight the frizz when I walk outside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JDPS7I/?tag=weea-20">KMS California Free Shape</a>-So I&#8217;ve used this twice now and I&#8217;m pretty sure it reduced my drying time considerably, but I did have a certain 5 month old screaming off and on during the drying process, so I&#8217;ll keep you posted on this one.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.asp?pid=226210&#038;catid=157879&#038;aid=335949&#038;aparam=QFGLnEolOWg-zSAgRHaa3xtf_9VWQYlgEQ">Blow Weather Girl Climate Neutralizing Complex</a>-This has definitely worked the two times I have used it. I have not had frizz problems as of late.  However I&#8217;d love to try this in the summer when it&#8217;s super duper humid and hot to see how it does.</p>
<p>Have y&#8217;all tried anything lately that you think is the bomb? Care to share?</p>
