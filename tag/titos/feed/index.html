		<description><![CDATA[<p>A husband of a <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/sarah/">Tipsy Girl </a>turned the BIG 3-0 this past week, so OF COURSE in true tipsy style we had to make sure he rang in his 30s the tipsy way. We created a shot we called The Dirty Thirty with miscellaneous items that we had on hand. It turned out to taste like a jolly rancher and produced the intoxifying result that we were looking for.</p>
<p>Mix equal parts Monster Energy Drink and Smirnoff Ice Watermelon with a shot of Vodka in a highball glass.</p>
