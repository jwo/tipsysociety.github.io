		<description><![CDATA[<p>Remember our <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/08/giveaway-thirty-one-tote/">Thirty-One Giveaway</a>? Do you guys remember that Tipsy Reader Charing won?  She said in her comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have four kids and a dog that I chauffeur all over town in my minivan. I would use the tote as a catch all to keep everyones “stuff” from rolling around in the car.  It also looks big enough to put a picnic dinner in for my large family.</p></blockquote>
<p>Charing gave us an update on what bag she chose and sent along a picture.  We thought it was TOO CUTE and wanted to share with the other Tipsy Readers!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Remember our <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/06/corral-boots-giveaway/">boot giveaway</a>? Yes, of course we all remember lusting after all those Corral boots from <a href="http://www.langstons.com/corral-cowboy-boots-womens.html">Langston&#8217;s</a>! Well our winner, Sara (who picked <a href="http://www.langstons.com/corral-boots-womens-lizard-overlay-c2118.html">these boots</a>-I&#8217;m very jealous!!) has graciously decided to pay it forward and do a giveaway of her own! Sara sells immense cuteness from <a href="http://www.mythirtyone.com/SaraBagley">Thirty-One</a> and is very graciously giving away one Large Utility Tote in the fabric of the winner&#8217;s choosing along with the embroidery of their choosing.</p>
