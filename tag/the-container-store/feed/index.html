		<description><![CDATA[<p>Last year was the first year I really made New Year&#8217;s <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2009/12/new-years-resolutions-ak-edition/">resolutions</a>.  I think I was a bit too ambitious with some of my list.  I did plow through several of them, but a couple just were not feasible.  I definitely got my closet organized, the extra bedroom closet organized and the junk drawer organized.  I got in more date nights with my hubby and made a ton of those movie nights as well!  I started off the year reading a lot more but ended the year with not reading again.</p>
<p>So this year I&#8217;ve decided to shorten my list and have everything be 100% attainable.  Here goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>After having a baby in May, definitely get back into my twice a week gym routine, no matter what. (shoes <a href="http://www.zappos.com/product/7680038/color/250315">here</a>.)</li>
<li>Take more pictures.  We took a ton of pictures of my son his first year and at a certain point that sorta dropped off.  I want to have these memories and I definitely want the new baby to have all of his baby pictures to look at when he&#8217;s older as well. (Does anyone have one of these &#8220;best of both worlds&#8221; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003MPOLX2/?tag=weea-20">cameras</a>? yay or nay?)</li>
<li>Get craftier.  I still want to do the baby clothes quilt of my son&#8217;s first year.  I would love to <a href="http://www.purlbee.com/the-purl-bee/2010/12/5/purl-soho-kits-super-easy-baby-blankets-are-back-plus-5-new.html">crochet a blanket</a>. I would also love to start doing more crafty projects with my son, especially for Christmas!  If I get one of these accomplished this year I will count that as a success!</li>
<li>Keep <a href="http://www.containerstore.com/shop?productId=10023938&amp;N=&amp;Ntt=drawer">organized</a> along the way.  We just cleaned out the extra bedroom to make room for baby #2 and it was super simple because we had organized it last year.  I want to continue to keep things organized so that I don&#8217;t have to take time to overhaul things because it&#8217;s gotten so bad.</li>
</ol>
<p>So there you have it, much shorter but I think definitely attainable!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m typically an organized person, but I feel like, here lately, I&#8217;ve been living in organized chaos. So, I&#8217;m officially on a mission to get every closet, drawer, and cabinet in tip-top-shape over the next few months. Here are some recent finds that are helping me with my mission.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Container Store, <a href="http://www.containerstore.com/shop/closet/cubesBins?productId=10020375" target="_blank">Feathergrain Bins</a>: Bins, any bin, are great for those odds and ends that you really don&#8217;t have a place for. They can be stored under any table, or anything for that matter, to chicly disguise your clutter.</li>
<li>OXO, <a href="http://www.oxo.com/OA_HTML/xxoxo_ibeCCtpOXOPrdDtl.jsp?section=10764&amp;item=82294&amp;minisite=10024&amp;respid=53057" target="_blank">POP Containers</a>: These are really great for your pantry because they allow you to see just how much of each food item you have left, which, if you&#8217;re like me, it&#8217;s a necessity. Example: I always buy pasta at the store because I&#8217;m never sure how much I have; then, I get home and I have always have bazillion pounds of it stashed away!</li>
<li>The Container Store, <a href="http://www.containerstore.com/shop/closet/storageBoxes?productId=10024310" target="_blank">Storage Boxes</a>: These pretty boxes are inexpensive, yet, they look so pretty holding all the clutter that I have in my closets&#8230;</li>
<li>The Container Store, <a href="http://www.containerstore.com/shop/office/fileStorage/portable?productId=10027114" target="_blank">Portable File Boxes</a>: I buy a new one of these every year to hold all my bills, essential paper work, tax info, etc, and when the year is over, I neatly put it away for easy access should I need any of that information in the future. It&#8217;s a lot easier than having bulky filing cabinets everywhere.</li>
<li>The Container Store, <a href="http://www.containerstore.com/shop/closet/underbedStorage?productId=10012690" target="_blank">Underbed Boxes</a>: Why let all that space under your bed go unused?</li>
<li>The Container Store, <a href="http://www.containerstore.com/shop/bath/shelving?productId=10016271" target="_blank">Cube Storage</a>: Super-cute alternatives to shelves!</li>
<li>Rubbermaid, <a href="http://www.rubbermaid.com/Category/Pages/SubCategoryLanding.aspx?SpaceId=Closet(RubbermaidSpaces)&amp;SubcatId=CleverStore&amp;CatName=Storage" target="_blank">Clever Store</a>: I&#8217;m a sucker for a Rubbermaid product, and what I like about these is that they&#8217;re clear&#8230;aka, you don&#8217;t have to open the box to see what&#8217;s inside!</li>

	<p>I&#8217;m typically an organized person, but I feel like, here lately, I&#8217;ve been living in organized chaos. So, I&#8217;m officially on a mission to get every closet, drawer, and cabinet in tip-top-shape over the next few months. Here are some recent finds that are helping me with my mission.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Container Store, <a href="http://www.containerstore.com/shop/closet/cubesBins?productId=10020375" target="_blank">Feathergrain Bins</a>: Bins, any bin, are great for those odds and ends that you really don&#8217;t have a place for. They can be stored under any table, or anything for that matter, to chicly disguise your clutter.</li>
<li>OXO, <a href="http://www.oxo.com/OA_HTML/xxoxo_ibeCCtpOXOPrdDtl.jsp?section=10764&amp;item=82294&amp;minisite=10024&amp;respid=53057" target="_blank">POP Containers</a>: These are really great for your pantry because they allow you to see just how much of each food item you have left, which, if you&#8217;re like me, it&#8217;s a necessity. Example: I always buy pasta at the store because I&#8217;m never sure how much I have; then, I get home and I have always have bazillion pounds of it stashed away!</li>
<li>The Container Store, <a href="http://www.containerstore.com/shop/closet/storageBoxes?productId=10024310" target="_blank">Storage Boxes</a>: These pretty boxes are inexpensive, yet, they look so pretty holding all the clutter that I have in my closets&#8230;</li>
<li>The Container Store, <a href="http://www.containerstore.com/shop/office/fileStorage/portable?productId=10027114" target="_blank">Portable File Boxes</a>: I buy a new one of these every year to hold all my bills, essential paper work, tax info, etc, and when the year is over, I neatly put it away for easy access should I need any of that information in the future. It&#8217;s a lot easier than having bulky filing cabinets everywhere.</li>
<li>The Container Store, <a href="http://www.containerstore.com/shop/closet/underbedStorage?productId=10012690" target="_blank">Underbed Boxes</a>: Why let all that space under your bed go unused?</li>
