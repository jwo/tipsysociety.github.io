		<description><![CDATA[<p>I scream, you scream, we all scream for _________! It&#8217;s the PERFECT summer snack&#8230;here&#8217;s our faves, what&#8217;s yours?</p>
<ol>
<li>Sarah: <a href="http://www.bluebell.com/IceCreamFlavor?fid=18" target="_blank">Blue Bell Cookies and Cream</a>, This has been my all time favorite since I was little. I don&#8217;t eat a ton of ice creamÂ (and my ass thanks me for that), but if I ever have a craving, you can bet that I&#8217;m headed straight for Blue Bell Cookies and Cream!!!! (And yes, it has to be Blue Bell&#8230;)</li>
<li>AK: <a href="http://www.bluebell.com/IceCreamFlavor?fid=21" target="_blank">Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla</a>, When it comes to ice cream I&#8217;m very plain jane.Â  I&#8217;m a huge fan of Der&#8217;s pick but if I&#8217;m buying ice cream at the grocery store or somewhere not McDonald&#8217;s then I&#8217;m definitely going with Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla.Â  And like Sarah said, yes it has to be Blue Bell.</li>
<li>Court: <a href="http://tcby.com/" target="_blank">TCBY White Chocolate Mousse</a>, TCBY&#8217;s White Chocolate Mousse.Â  Easy on the cals, awesome ass flavor.Â  I always, always add sprinkles to mine.Â  I don&#8217;t really keep ice cream in the house, and there is a probably a reason for that ðŸ™‚</li>
<li>Der: <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en/food/full_menu/desserts_and_shakes/vanilla_reduced_fat_ice_cream_cone.html" target="_blank">McDonalds Vanilla Cone</a>, There will never ever be an ice cream that will beat McDonald&#8217;s ice cream cones in my book. I used this as my weight loss crutch back in the day.. it&#8217;s low cal and mighty delish!</li>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>My now husband proposed to me in late 2007 after having dated for over 6 years. Imagine how THRILLED I was to finally get that rock on my finger! Then I saw a pic of me + 6 chins from the night of our engagement&#8230; thrill <em>over</em>, well sorta.Â  Good news: Fiance loves me and all my chins. Bad news: I have GOT to get rid of this shit before I walk down that aisle!Â  Over the next 6 months, I lost about 50 pounds.Â  Here were my staple weightloss foods for those of you who are looking to lose a couple chins yourselves.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-564" title="der-diet food" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/der-diet-food.png" alt="der-diet food" width="500" height="374" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/der-diet-food.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/der-diet-food-300x224.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Smart Ones Baked Ziti-The perfect lunch. The cheese ratio is ultra high, so this is a cheese lover&#8217;s delight.</li>
<li>Nature&#8217;s Own Wheat Light-Toast, sammiches, you name it&#8230; 40 calories a slice and good.</li>
<li>HoneyCrisp Apples-As sweet as candy, but not candy and therefore a good choice.</li>
<li>McDonald&#8217;s Ice Cream Cone-150 calories is a small price to pay for the deliciousness that is this treat. I am decently sure that I drained majority of my local Mickey D&#8217;s of all ice cream inventory during 2008.</li>
<li>Frigo Cheese Head Light String Cheese-50% less fat than other cheese and still cheese, so perfect.</li>
</ol>
