<ol>
<li>AK-<a href="http://www.weeatt.com/recipe/broccoli_rice_casserole">Broccoli Rice Casserole</a>-When I think about Thanksgiving this is the side that I think of: Broccoli Rice Casserole.  If this side is not made during Thanksgiving, it&#8217;s just not Thanksgiving to me.  I could seriously eat my weight in this stuff and I am always first in line to take leftovers home.  I&#8217;ve had this before made with Jalapeno Cheese Whiz and OMG&#8230;SO GOOD.  However I do believe they discontinued Jalapeno Cheese Whiz.  I&#8217;m still pissed.</li>
<li>Der-<a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2007/11/delicious_creamy_mashed_potatoes/">Mashed Potatoes</a>-Please don&#8217;t hate, but I&#8217;m not in LOOVE with thanksgiving food. I don&#8217;t like turkey unless it&#8217;s on a sammich and all the other stuff I could honeslty take or leave. But I&#8217;m a sucker for some creamy mashed taters on any occasion!</li>
<li>Court-<a href="http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,1915,144180-249206,00.html">Cornbread Dressing</a>-A few things about this dish before I tell you why its my own fav.  1.  Cornbread dressing is where its at.  Its dressing, not stuffing because it never goes IN the turkey.  And cornbread, first fried in a cast iron skillet and baked in the oven until golden brown is the way to go.  2.  This is closest recipe I could find online to my mom&#8217;s, Mimi&#8217;s, superawesometopsecret recipe.  3.  I opt out on the onions.  No can do on that.  Now that you know all the rules, please know that this is my ultimate side for Thanksgiving and the holiday season in general.  I can&#8217;t do with out it and am slowly learning from Mimi the actual art that makes this dish so good that I eat myself silly each year.</li>
<li>Sarah-<a href="http://www.campbellskitchen.com/recipedetail.aspx?recipeId=24099">Green Bean Casserole</a>-Green Bean Casserole is a MUST for me. I have loved this stuff for as long as I can remember, and, unfortunately, my in-laws don&#8217;t agree that this is a Thanksgiving staple. However, when we do spend the holiday with them, I always make and bring my own because, you know, it&#8217;s not Thanksgiving without green bean casserole&#8230;and it&#8217;s ALWAYS gone at the end of the meal&#8230;seems to me like this SHOULD be their new staple since it&#8217;s obviously a hit!</li>
