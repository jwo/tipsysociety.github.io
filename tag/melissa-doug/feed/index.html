		<description><![CDATA[<p>I have a two year old and dinners out can be challenging to say the least.  I mean you want to go out to dinner so that you don&#8217;t have to cook every single night but at the same time you don&#8217;t want to go out so you can shovel the food in as fast as you can because the kiddo is DONE DONE DONE, mama DONE?</p>
<p>Enter our latest distraction, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000SONEQA/?tag=weea-20">Melissa &amp; Doug Bead Maze</a>!  The best part of this toy is that it has suction cups on the bottom.  I know some places this won&#8217;t work, but the places we frequent the most, it does.  So I thought I&#8217;d share what has been working for us lately.  Also, this ranges in age from 12months to 4 YEARS.  That&#8217;s almost crazy insane.</p>
