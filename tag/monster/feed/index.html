		<description><![CDATA[<p>I was in my local grocery store stocking up on <a href="http://www.monsterenergy.com/us/en/products/">Monsters</a> when I came across something that i felt the need to share with you ladies. Me and my sister are a bit obsessed with the low cal monster drinks to begin with, so when i saw <a href="http://www.monsterenergy.com/us/en/products/rehab/">Monster Rehab</a> on the shelf I was super excited. Its a tea and lemonade energy drink with only 10 calories! I was a bit skeptical at first, being that it is not carbonated but my worry was all for not. Delicious. It tastes like regular lemonade, with no energy drink taste at all.  So go forth and energize, ladies, your taste buds will thank you.</p>

		<title>Hump Day Happy Hour: March Madness On Crack</title>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>March Madness began last week.  For those of you who don&#8217;t know, it is the huge NCAA college basketball tournament. I happened to be in Las Vegas when it began, and let me tell you, those people were definitely on something. Was it crack, or just a shit ton of alcohol, we will never know. What I do know is that it was crazy. Now, I am not a big basketball fan, but this year Houston is the lucky host of the Final Four so I thought I should celebrate that with a cocktail (even though my team lost in the first round&#8230;).</p>
<p>1 oz Peach Schnapps<br />
1 oz Triple Sec<br />
1 1/2 oz Vodka<br />
4 oz  Monster Energy Drink<br />
3 oz Orange Gatorade</p>
<p>Mix it all together and serve in a highball glass.</p>
<p>* The recipe actually calls for Amp energy drink but I personally think it is disgusting so I changed it to Monster. If you are anti-energy drink, I imagine this drink would taste good without that ingredient, although you may want to add some soda so its not too strong&#8230;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>A husband of a <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/sarah/">Tipsy Girl </a>turned the BIG 3-0 this past week, so OF COURSE in true tipsy style we had to make sure he rang in his 30s the tipsy way. We created a shot we called The Dirty Thirty with miscellaneous items that we had on hand. It turned out to taste like a jolly rancher and produced the intoxifying result that we were looking for.</p>
<p>Mix equal parts Monster Energy Drink and Smirnoff Ice Watermelon with a shot of Vodka in a highball glass.</p>
