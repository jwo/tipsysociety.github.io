		<description><![CDATA[<p>So my last iPhone app post was about <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/03/iphone-apps-peekaboo-barn/">games for the wee ones</a> and today I&#8217;m gonna show you a game that is probably supposed to BE for the wee ones but I seem to like it just fine.</p>
<p>Do you guys remember the books Where&#8217;s Waldo where you find the little dude in the striped shirt in the midst of a ton of other distracting things?  I sure do, I believe I had a Where&#8217;s Waldo t-shirt that I worked out in, when I was <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">22 </span>12. I honestly don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m alone because I in fact just saw a Where&#8217;s Waldo book in the waiting room of my NON pediatric dentist&#8217;s office just last week.  So there.</p>
<p>Well now they have a <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id342842881?mt=8">Where&#8217;s Waldo iPhone app</a>.  I find it quite addicting and to me its always nice to have something to do if I&#8217;m waiting somewhere and I don&#8217;t have anything to read and I just really want to zone out&#8230;It&#8217;s a mindless yet satisfying little app.</p>
