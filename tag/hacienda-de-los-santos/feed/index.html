		<description><![CDATA[<p>As promised, I&#8217;m featuring another favorite Mexican vacation.  <a href="http://www.haciendadelossantos.com">Hacienda de los Santos</a> is where my husband and I went for our honeymoon.  If you want to go somewhere that is chill and you need a little pampering&#8230;this is the place!  Beautiful grounds, gorgeous hotel. The little town is SUPER CLEAN, like the cleanest Mexican town I&#8217;ve ever seen in my life.</p>
<p>Hacienda de los Santos has a cantina on site that holds more types of tequila than you can count, has the best huevos rancheros and guacamole you&#8217;ll ever have and the nicest owners you&#8217;ll ever meet.  There is a movie theater on the grounds that you can pick what you want to watch and  have them bring you guac and beer or margs!  There is a spa, fabulous mariachis at dinner, and if you catch it at the right time&#8211;cooking classes (we did, FTW!)</p>
<p>Each room is named after a saint and ours was <a href="http://www.haciendadelossantos.com/Photo_Tour/body%20accom%20suites%20lucia.html">Santa Lucia</a>.  Fabulous.  Trust me.  Go. Order the guac.</p>
