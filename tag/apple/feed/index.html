		<description><![CDATA[<p>So, my better half got an iPad.  The kiddo has renamed the iPad &#8220;the big phone&#8221; because most of the games he can play on our iPhones he can now play on the iPad.  One of those games is <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/preschool-memory-match/id368542467?mt=8">Preschool Memory Match</a> and what I LOVE about it is that each game is different and it says the name of whatever is behind the card out loud whether it&#8217;s an animal or musical instrument or whatever.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/AWo/status/54993895188205568">The downside of this game</a>:</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>We had a great Christmas! My husband and I think this year has been the best so far in terms of celebrating with our son.  He got excited to hand out gifts and open gifts and play with everything.  It was super fun.  Here are a few things I got for Christmas this year:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.brookstone.com/ultrasonic-jewelry-cleaner-dvd-cleaners.html?his=2%7E46337%7E2%7Eroot_category%40kwd%7Ejewelry&amp;bkiid=searchResults|C4CategoryProdList1FDT|8417281">Jewelry Cleaner</a>, Brookstone-If you&#8217;ve ever thought about getting one of these things, do it! Do it now! All you do is add water and it uses sound waves to clean everything.  I immediately did my wedding ring and watch and embarrassed at the amount of gunk that came off both of them.  And I THOUGHT I kept them clean.  This also does eyeglasses, which I haven&#8217;t done yet but am psyched to do.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.jcrew.com/womens_category/sweaters/cardigans/PRDOVR~29350/29350.jsp">Jackie cardigan</a>, J.Crew-I love these cardigans and buy them at the outlet store or ask for them as gifts.  I&#8217;m a cardigan addict.  I received navy and cerise for Christmas.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.katespade.com/product/index.jsp?productId=4075994&amp;cp=4335762.2065600">iPhone Case</a>, Kate Spade-I was in need of a new case and received one like this and it&#8217;s right up my alley what with all the colors!!</li>
<li><a href="http://store.apple.com/us/personalize/apple?mco=MTc0MjU2MDE&amp;product=MA210">Apple gift card</a>, Apple-In combination with my husband we received enough apple gift cards to purchase an iPad.  However after a twitter questionnaire we&#8217;ve decided to wait on the next version to come out before we buy it.  I think that&#8217;s in April.  I think.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000W8V4WS/?tag=weea-20">iSi Flexible Mixing Bowls</a>, Amazon-A month or so ago, in an effort to do something in the kitchen, I gave my son a couple of mixing bowls and a wooden spoon to occupy him.  That turned into me needing new bowls.  I don&#8217;t think these will break.</li>
</ol>
<p>The best gift of all might be what Santa brought my son.  He loves it more than anything and it gives his parents a chance to sit and chill for a few minutes. <a href="http://www.walmart.com/ip/Little-Star-Bouncer/10172315">Little Star Bouncer</a>, Walmart</p>

<li><a title="Moon Shoes" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00007BKUN/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Moon Shoes</a> &#8211; remember these babies?  Theeeiiirrr back and on Aus&#8217; Christmas list.  I&#8217;m  just worried for when he asks mommy to give these a go.</li>
<li><a title="Basketball Goal" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0015S9FPW/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Basketball goal</a> &#8211; great for the active boy, but portable, so can be stored, moved, or taken into the middle of the cul-de-sac when the boys really want to get schooled by mommy.</li>
<li><a title="DSI" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0045FCK68/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">DSI XL Special Edition</a> &#8211; yes, another one.  And it haasss to be the red one, its for the 25th anniversary of the nintendo Gameboy/DS console.  I think we can all remember what fun these were no matter how old we were.</li>
<li><a title="iPod Touch" href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_ipod/family/ipod_touch?mco=MTM3NDkxNTM" target="_blank">iPod Touch</a> &#8211; This was on Aus&#8217; list, but not making the cut just yet.  We opted for the DSI XL for a little bit longer, but these are really really hot right now.</li>
<li><a title="BopIt" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0036RIMNQ/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">BopIt Bounce</a> &#8211; harder and possibly more annoying than the original BopIt.  Dreams really do come true!</li>
<li><a title="UT Snuggie" href="http://www.sportsnuggies.com/p-1649-texas-longhorns-college-snuggie.aspx" target="_blank">College Snuggie</a> &#8211; Aus&#8217; has really gotten into collegiate sports.  The name of the game around this house in the Texas Longhorns (even though their football is less than stellar right now).  Aus will not be a fair weather fan though and I think this is the perfect accessory for someone that devoted.</li>
<li><a title="Andre Johnson Jersey" href="http://www.sportsauthority.com/product/index.jsp?productId=1777659&amp;CAWELAID=116728665" target="_blank">NFL Jersey (Andre Johnson</a>) &#8211; adding to the obsession with football players and sports in general.  This time the Houston Texans.  A jersey of a little boy&#8217;s fav team is a shoe-in for a gift.</li>

</ol>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be one very merry Christmas around here!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Last week Susan at The Working Closet did a post entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/workingcloset/2010/10/13/five-things-i-never-leave-home-without/">5 Things I Never Leave Home Without</a>&#8220;.  These are things that no matter where she&#8217;s going she never leaves home without them.  So it got me thinking&#8230;what would that be for me?  Some of the things she had on her list were on my list but some were also different.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3020908?origin=PredictiveSearch&amp;resultback=100">Hobo International Lauren Wallet</a>-I think this is probably a given for most people but no matter what I am taking this with me because it houses a lot of the items below.  Mine isn&#8217;t yellow, it&#8217;s turquoise but alas I could not find that picture to show you.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/templates/products/spp/index.tmpl?CATEGORY_ID=CATEGORY22745&amp;PRODUCT_ID=PROD1112">Bobbi Brown Cosmetics Lip Color in Slopes</a>-I come from a long line of ladies that without a doubt never go out without lipstick on.  Even my grandma at 88 would always have her lipstick on at all times.  We seem a little crazy don&#8217;t we?  We aren&#8217;t, I promise&#8230;we only have a slight case of the crazies.  So anyway, this is my fall/winter color that I wear.  I get sorta attached to lipshades and tend to stick with one color for a long long time.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">My iPhone</a>-Because I will never forget the time when I ran out of gas and didn&#8217;t have my cell phone with me and I had to ask the person in the car next to me if I could use their cell to call my husband.  Awful, on so many levels.  At this point, with an iPhone it is also a great toddler distractor as well.</li>
<li><a href="http://patemm.com/">Patemm Pad</a>-Because I have a toddler, I can&#8217;t ever leave home without diaper equipment.  This changing pad is the best changing pad ever and I&#8217;ve told you about it <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2009/11/the-best-changing-pad-ever/">before</a>. I love that this pad can also hold my diapers and wipes and has a handle for carrying.  The best part about this changing pad is that its round and no matter where your kiddo is flailing, the changing pad will generally guard them from the scariness that is public restrooms.  My particular style of Patemm is called the &#8220;Deke&#8221; which I don&#8217;t think they make anymore, but you can definitely find some cuteness on their site.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001IAG7G2/?tag=weea-20">Aquaphor Lip Balm</a>-I can never put lipstick on without first putting a lip balm on and while I have been a devotee of the L&#8217;Occitane Shea Butter Lip Balm, it&#8217;s just too easy to pick up this Aquaphor Lip Balm at the grocery store or drug store.  It also works well in a mini manicure situation on your cuticles.</li>
</ol>
<p>So tell me, what 5 things do you never leave home without?</p>

<li>Sarah-I&#8217;ve had a <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/digital_cameras/powershot_sd940_is#Features">camera</a> very similar to this one for 3 years and I love it for several reasons: 1) it&#8217;s resilient 2) it takes great pictures 3) it has a wide viewing screen that allows you to preview your pics without squinting!</li>
<li>Der-I got this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002JCSV5I/?tag=weea-20">camera</a> for Christmas last year after much begging and pleading. See, my track record wasn&#8217;t too good for not breaking previous cameras I have owned. Now, almost a year later it&#8217;s still kickin and taking great pictures. I still have so much to learn about the settings, etc but I&#8217;m just happy that it&#8217;s still intact. I would like a small take in your purse type camera too, any suggestions??</li>
<li>AK-So this is one of those camcorders that also takes pics and my father-in-law got it for us when my son was born as a baby gift/Christmas gift/both of our birthdays the following year gifts hahahahaha! And we love it.  We love the pictures it takes and we love the videos it takes.  For my son&#8217;s first birthday we setup a &#8220;photobooth&#8221; by putting it on a tripod and swiveling the screen so you can see yourself and using the remote control it comes with.  Can&#8217;t say enough good things about this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00123WDR2/?tag=weea-20 ">camera</a>.</li>
<li>Court-Ben and I have a small cam that we try to remember to bring with us at all times. But that rarely, errr, never happens. Anyone who knows me knows I&#8217;m constantly snapping shots with my <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a>. Works for now and I always know I&#8217;ll have it on hand.</li>
