		<description><![CDATA[<p>For my son&#8217;s first birthday last year, we had the whole shebang at our house.  That was exactly what we wanted then, something for close friends and family.  At one, my kiddo hadn&#8217;t really made a lot of friends yo, so the party was more for the adults.  This year we decided to do it at <a href="http://www.thelittlegym.com/pages/default.aspx">The Little Gym</a>.  We attend a weekly class and he loves the HELL out of that place, so it was a no brainer.  We didn&#8217;t pick a specific theme, we just decided to have balloons and cupcake toppers of all his favorite characters.  We used the <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2009/10/9-ways-to-make-a-first-birthday-the-bomb/">same banners from last year and the same party hats</a> as last year but we added new stickers to showcase what the ole boy looks like at 2.  I think I&#8217;m definitely going to make that a tradition, just keep using the same banner and hats as long as we can hack it but update the pic on the sticker&#8211;I mean he&#8217;s so damn cute! hahahaha!  This year we actually had a few more kids because the lil guy has made a few friends, granted we introduced him because they are the kids of our friends but you know&#8230;friends! He&#8217;s got friends now!  So we invited them and we had party favors involved this time around.  For the girls we decided to give crayon rolls with princess shaped crayons and for the boys we had car rolls with a little matchbox cars.  Anyway it was a huge hit and everybody had fun and we didn&#8217;t have to clean up before and clean up after.  It was the bomb, I highly recommend it.</p>
