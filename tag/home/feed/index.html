		<description><![CDATA[<p>Like most young couples, my husband and I got married and bought a house all within about a year of each other. Needless to say, money was a little tight, BUT I still wanted to decorate my house super-cute&#8230;so I figured out a GREAT solution: frame pictures that you take with your own camera!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-775" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/sk-house-pics.png" alt="sk-house pics" width="500" height="668" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/sk-house-pics.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/sk-house-pics-224x300.png 224w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>Above are pictures from my home where I have done this very thing. I&#8217;ve started actually taking pictures from our vacations, blowing them up, putting them in gallery frames, and hanging them on the wall. So then, not only do I have budget-friendly wall art, but I also have an AWESOME souvenir that I can look at daily! (BTW, I took these pictures with a small point and shoot camera, not a big fancy one.)</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-776" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/sk-house-pic-ny.png" alt="sk-house pic ny" width="500" height="376" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/sk-house-pic-ny.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/sk-house-pic-ny-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p><a href="http://tipsysociety.com/ak/" target="_blank">AK</a> showed this wall art idea to me last week and I felt like I had to share it with everyone else! Here, Lisa Mahar featured her rather amazing home on the <a href="http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/node/32280" target="_blank">New York Social Diary</a>, and her headboard in her master bedroom consists of a gallery of personal photos that all combine into a great piece of art.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I&#8217;m putting this idea to work in my own home STAT. All I will need are more of my own great pictures and a trip to Ikea for some awesome, simple, and cheap frames!</p>
