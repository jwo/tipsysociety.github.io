		<description><![CDATA[<p>My oldest is going to start preschool this fall (OMG where did the time go??) and he&#8217;s going to have to start bringing his lunch with him.  So I went on a hunt for a lunchbox and I THINK I&#8217;ve narrowed it down to these two.  The pros are that I won&#8217;t need to put anything in baggies.  Anybody out there have either of these and can tell me the cons?</p>
