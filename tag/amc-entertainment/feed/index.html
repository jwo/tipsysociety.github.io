		<description><![CDATA[<p>I never make New Year&#8217;s Resolutions. Ever.  But I thought, you know, we are going into this year a little different than any year before and I thought, why not.  I think it&#8217;ll be fun to look back and see if I could pull any of this off in a year.  So here goes:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1817" title="ak-resolutions" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/ak-resolutions.png" alt="ak-resolutions" width="500" height="768" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/ak-resolutions.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/ak-resolutions-195x300.png 195w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Try and take a <a href="http://www.zappos.com/new-balance-wr769-pink">walk</a> with the kiddo every day if weather allows.</li>
<li>Learn to sew, like for real with my new Christmas gift.  My ultimate goal:  a <a href="http://www.jellybeanquilts.com/samples.htm">baby clothes memory quilt</a>.</li>
<li>Implement some sort of regularly occurring date night that went to shit when we had our bouncing baby boy.</li>
<li>Get back into <a href="http://www.amcentertainment.com/">going to more movies</a> SOMEHOW, SOMEWAY!  My mom and I used to go to a movie every Sunday pre-bebe and pre-2009.  I need my theater watching experience por favor.</li>
<li>Organize!  Organize the junk drawer in the kitchen, organize the closets in the extra bedroom and finally organize my closet (trying on clothes and seeing what actually fits and doesn&#8217;t). (and just FYI that&#8217;s not my closet, you don&#8217;t want to see it)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Read more</a> and when I say more, like maybe a whole book.  Magazines don&#8217;t count.  Google Reader doesn&#8217;t count.  I may even go so far as to go for 10 books in 2010.</li>
