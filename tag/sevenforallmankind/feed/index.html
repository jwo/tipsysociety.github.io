<li>Der:Â  <a title="537s" href="http://cgi.ebay.com/LEVI'S-537~LOW-R~FLARE-WOMEN'S-JEANS~SZ:-8-M~AWESOME-!_W0QQitemZ160416443919QQcmdZViewItemQQimsxZ20100324?IMSfp=TL100324142004r15596#ht_4708wt_958" target="_blank">Levis 537s</a> Description Der found that she say is perfect: The Levi&#8217;s 537 Flare Jean is a classic Levi&#8217;s style. The soft heavy feel of the denim and five pocket styling are the perfect combination. The 537 is built to withstand all of the wear and tear that you can dish. Der&#8217;s description ðŸ™‚ : I feel like they hug all the right places and look great dressed up or down. BUT, I have the HARDEST time locating them. I had to buy my last pair off ebay because I couldn&#8217;t find ANY stores that sell them. BIG BUMMER. In fact, the only pic I could find is on ebay so if your a lucky size 8&#8230;snatch these UP!</li>
