		<description><![CDATA[<p>I consider this the home stretch of planning all the get togethers and meals surrounding the holiday season.  This is sure to be a crowd pleaser, looks its takes a bit of prep, but could really pay off!</p>
<ul>
<li>1.5 liters Ocean Spray raspberry cranberry, well chilled</li>
<li>2  bottles of sparkling wine, well chilled</li>
<li>1/2 cup Cointreau</li>
<li>2 limes, quartered</li>
<li>1 cup strawberries, washed, halved</li>
<li>3/4 cup blueberries</li>
<li>1/2 cup raspberries</li>
<li>1/4 cup fresh mint leaves</li>
</ul>
<p>Pour the cranberry juice, sparkling wine and Cointreau into a punch bowl. Use your hands to squeeze some of the juice from the limes into the punch. Stir. Add the squeezed limes to the punch. Add the strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and mint leaves. Dunzo.</p>
<p>Some of the other tipsy gals have really cool pitchers to serve this out of, like the ones shown <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/11/hostest-with-the-mostest/" target="_blank">here</a>, I think it would be a shoe-in to a berry merry Christmas!</p>
