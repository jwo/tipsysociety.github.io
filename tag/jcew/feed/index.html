		<description><![CDATA[<p>I was in Boston last weekend on a mini-vaca where I surprised my baseball-loving hubby with tickets to see the Red Sox play at the historic Fenway Park!!! (By doing this, I have automatically dubbed myself &#8220;Best Wife Ever.&#8221;)</p>
<p>However, I will tell you that my title was in jeopardy on our walk to the ball park last Friday night. I had the tickets in the back pocket of my oh so cute distressed skinny jeans from <a href="http://www.jcrew.com/AST/Browse/WomenBrowse/Women_Shop_By_Category/denim/vintageslim/PRDOVR~16426/16426.jsp" target="_blank">JCrew</a>, but when I reached in my pocket for the tickets, they were GONE!!!!! I mean, they were literally lost in a sea of baseball-<span style="text-decoration: line-through">freaks</span>lovers&#8230;</p>
<p>Luckily, we were able to back track our steps and find them before anyone else did. The game was so much fun and I&#8217;ve literally never seen my hubby as giddy as he was when we walked into that ball park!</p>
<p>(BTW, did you know that you can get clam chowder at Fenway? Well, you can&#8230;)</p>
