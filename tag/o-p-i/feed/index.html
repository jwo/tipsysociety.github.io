		<description><![CDATA[<p>As a lifetime nailbiter, I find myself getting constant manicures just to prevent my finger tips from looking like gnarled, peeling numbs. Since I have picked up this manicure habit, I have fallen head over heels with <a href="http://www.opi.com/">O.P.I. Nail Color</a>. The names are funky and there is a shade for every mood or occasion.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000CECSAO/?tag=weea-20">Bubble Bath</a>: This is the shade I wore on my wedding day. The perfect neutral pink to make you look like you have perfect nails without even trying.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0013829TS/?tag=weea-20">Lincoln Park at Midnight</a>: My perfect funky fall color for when I&#8217;m feeling a little RockStarish. Its a deep, deep burgundy purple and cool as a fan.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000V04ZLE/?tag=weea-20">Vodka &amp; Caviar</a>: Sassy red for when I want to bring out my inner pin up girl.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000PRXBOK/?tag=weea-20">Mod About You</a>: This is a lighter, whiter based neutral pink, but it&#8217;s a little more funky because it is shockingly lighter than my chalk-like fair complexion.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001DYFFCU/?tag=weea-20">You Don&#8217;t Know Jacques</a>!: This is my newest shade in rotation, from the Frances Collection. I wanted something neutral, but not pink. I get so many compliments on this shade when I wear it&#8230;it&#8217;s kind of a brownish taupe-gray.</li>
</ol>
<p>For The Holiday season I think I&#8217;m going to go with 6. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002ED51HS/?tag=weea-20">Smitten with Mittens </a>or           7. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002ED51HS/?tag=weea-20">Sapphire in the Snow</a>. What&#8217;s your favorite O.P.I. shade?</p>
