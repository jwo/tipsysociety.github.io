		<description><![CDATA[<p>Hey everybody, we&#8217;ve got a little giveaway today! I am definitely always on the hunt for some good iPhone or iPad apps for my kiddos.  I&#8217;ve got some favorites that I am going to tell you about tomorrow, however today I am going to tell you about some brand new apps by Night &amp; Day Studios!!</p>
<p>First up&#8230;<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/caillous-world-for-ipad/id463080119?mt=8">Caillou&#8217;s World for iPad</a><br />
<img src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ak-caillous-world.png" alt="" title="ak-caillous world" width="500" height="740" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9051" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ak-caillous-world.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ak-caillous-world-202x300.png 202w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><br />
Caillou&#8217;s World will show your child a scene in black and white and then highlight in color a specific object.  They then have to decide what letter that object starts with.  After they do this a few times the whole picture will show up in full color.  Your child will be overjoyed at this point. LOL!! </p>
<p>Next up&#8230;<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/peekaboo-barn-for-ipad/id465731441?mt=8">Peekaboo Barn</a>!<br />
<img src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ak-peekaboo-barn.png" alt="" title="ak-peekaboo barn" width="500" height="744" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9052" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ak-peekaboo-barn.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ak-peekaboo-barn-201x300.png 201w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><br />
Remember when we told you about <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/03/iphone-apps-peekaboo-barn/">Peekaboo Barn</a>? Well y&#8217;all it&#8217;s totally revamped! More languages! And my absolute favorite feature&#8230;record your own voice! The possibilities of the record your own voice thing you guys! Grandparents could record, Parents, an older sibling?! </p>
<p>Lastly, I want to tell you about <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/richard-scarrys-busytown-hd/id463858993?mt=8">Richard Scarry&#8217;s Busytown</a>.<br />
<img src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ak-scarry-busy-town.png" alt="" title="ak-scarry busy town" width="500" height="752" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9053" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ak-scarry-busy-town.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ak-scarry-busy-town-199x300.png 199w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><br />
I am super excited to try this app out with the kiddo.  You can dress characters, you can explore rooms and touch and interact with different items on the screen.  My first impression of this is that it&#8217;s similar to those Look &#038; Find books you see&#8230;try and find this item type of thing.  My son LOVES those kind of things, so I&#8217;m super pumped to play this with him.</p>
<p>So there you have it! Night &#038; Day Studios has so graciously decided to giveaway one of each of these new apps to one lucky Tipsy reader.</p>
<p>If you want to enter the giveaway, leave a comment letting us know which device you would use it on, your iPhone or iPad.</p>
<p><em>The Rules</p>
<p>One entry per person. No entries after 5:00 pm Central Time Friday.  Winners will be randomly selected from among entrants. Winners will be announced Monday.</em></p>
