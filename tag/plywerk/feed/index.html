		<description><![CDATA[<p>Have you heard about <a href="http://www.plywerk.com">Plywerk</a>? Basically Plywerk is designed to help you display artwork or photos in a super easy way.  There are two ways to go about it, you either upload a photo and have them do it or you can order everything and do it yourself.  It looks SUPER easy and I can think of SO MANY things to create this way!  The first thought I had is obviously instagram pics, but then I started really thinking&#8230;I think it would be a great alternative to getting a photo on canvas that is so popular these days.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s basically how it works:</p>

<p>And here&#8217;s just a sample of how it could look:</p>
<p>Cool huh? What would you do with it?</p>
