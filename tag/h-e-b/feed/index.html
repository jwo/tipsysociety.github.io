		<description><![CDATA[<p>I love my house. Like everyone&#8217;s humble abode, it&#8217;s still a work in progress, but these are some of the things I love the most!</p>
<ol>
<li>Dining Room: Specific things I love in here include the giant colorful urn in the corner, the cowhide rug, and the recently re-covered leather chairs.</li>
<li>Occasional Table: I found this table at a garage sale for $5! (And if you&#8217;re curious why I have these dogs hanging on my wall, this was a grand champion lab and he was a litter-mate to my first dog ever, Pearl. These pictures were hand me downs from my parents, but I absolutely love them.)</li>
<li>Kitchen: I bought this sign from the previous home owners&#8230;it really fit my style and thought it was a neat addition to the house.</li>
<li>Master Bedroom: (Where the magic happens&#8230;haha) No really, this is the new bedding I just got from <a href="http://www.restorationhardware.com/rh/index.jsp" target="_blank">Restoration Hardware</a>, what do you think?</li>
<li>Living Room: Doesn&#8217;t every home need a cute, patterned, chair? I think it adds a little something extra&#8230;</li>
<li>Side Table: This is a recent find of mine. It&#8217;s a metal end table with a black lacquer top. When my husband came home after I had bought this table it was sitting in the garage and he said, &#8220;Wow, thanks! That&#8217;s going to make a great addition to my workshop.&#8221; REALLY? he was quickly informed that this side table had style and was too cute to be found in a garage&#8230;</li>
<li>Study: Things to note in this room include my solid wood, very large, desk that was purchased at Target and my antique piano, which originally belonged to my great grandmother&#8230;what can I say, I love vintage/rustic EVERYTHING!</li>
<li>Patio Chairs: I have these chairs in all colors; turquoise, red, yellow, and green&#8230;they add a vintage feel to the patio, but what makes them even better is that I bought them at <a href="http://www.heb.com/welcome/index.jsp" target="_blank">H-E-B</a>! (That&#8217;s a grocery store to people who don&#8217;t live in Texas.)</li>
<li>BBQ Pit: What every home needs is not 1, but 2 BBQ pits in their backyard. (Look closely at the picture, you&#8217;ll see the second one covered up in the background.) I don&#8217;t understand the logic&#8230;I mean, I guess the second one is a back-up in case the first one explodes or walks away??? Whatever the reason, my hubby built this sucker with his own two hands (and a welding torch)&#8230;I have me a talented one ladies! (And I will never go hungry&#8230;)</li>
</ol>
