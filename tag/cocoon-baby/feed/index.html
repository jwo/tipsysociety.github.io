		<description><![CDATA[<p>My son has mild eczema here and there and we&#8217;ve used several different lotions and soaps and cremes along with a visit to a dermatologist.  When he has flare ups, we use a creme that the dermatologist gave us but lately we haven&#8217;t had any flare ups and we&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://www.enfusia.com/EnfusiaCocoon.asp">Cocoon Baby Body Wash</a>.  My mom first heard about this body wash in our local paper where it mentioned it was designed to treat eczema, so we picked some up at the grocery store. This body wash is phthalate free, paraben free and is in BPA free bottles along with it being cruelty free and vegan.  So good stuff basically. Try it, you might like it!</p>
