		<description><![CDATA[<p>Aquaphor is I swear a miracle product. I use this stuff on my chapped lips, on my cuticles, on anything really and I&#8217;m aways happy with the results. However, I JUST NOW realized that you can put these on your unsightly blemishes and it cuts the healing time in half!!! (I found this out after my skin decided to revert back to its 14 year old self..)</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>If you are like me, you&#8217;ve run out of time to get a manicure in before Thanksgiving.  So I&#8217;m going to share with you a little secret combo that will get your nails in decent shape in no time.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1064" title="ak-mini mani" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/ak-mini-mani.png" alt="ak-mini mani" width="500" height="248" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/ak-mini-mani.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/ak-mini-mani-300x148.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>Brush the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000MS5M7Q/?tag=weea-20">OPI oil</a> all along your nail bed, rub that in. Take the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001I90NEA/?tag=weea-20">Aquaphor lip treatment</a> and dab it at the base of each fingernail, rub that all around.  Then finish everything off with a little squeeze of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001B1831U/?tag=weea-20">Neutrogena Fast Absorbing Hand Lotion</a>.  That&#8217;s it!  It&#8217;s super quick and it&#8217;ll have your fingers looking 1000% better in no time.  I also keep these items in my car* or purse so that if I&#8217;m out and about and in need of some nail resuscitation.</p>
<p>*all steps can be completed sitting at a red light (TRUE STORY)</p>
