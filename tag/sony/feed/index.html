		<description><![CDATA[<p>We are some picture-taking fools. If there is an event or even just a casual dinner, we always have a camera to document what is happening. Here&#8217;s what we use to capture our everyday, what do you use?</p>
<ol>
<li>Sarah-I&#8217;ve had a <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/digital_cameras/powershot_sd940_is#Features">camera</a> very similar to this one for 3 years and I love it for several reasons: 1) it&#8217;s resilient 2) it takes great pictures 3) it has a wide viewing screen that allows you to preview your pics without squinting!</li>
<li>Der-I got this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002JCSV5I/?tag=weea-20">camera</a> for Christmas last year after much begging and pleading. See, my track record wasn&#8217;t too good for not breaking previous cameras I have owned. Now, almost a year later it&#8217;s still kickin and taking great pictures. I still have so much to learn about the settings, etc but I&#8217;m just happy that it&#8217;s still intact. I would like a small take in your purse type camera too, any suggestions??</li>
<li>AK-So this is one of those camcorders that also takes pics and my father-in-law got it for us when my son was born as a baby gift/Christmas gift/both of our birthdays the following year gifts hahahahaha! And we love it.  We love the pictures it takes and we love the videos it takes.  For my son&#8217;s first birthday we setup a &#8220;photobooth&#8221; by putting it on a tripod and swiveling the screen so you can see yourself and using the remote control it comes with.  Can&#8217;t say enough good things about this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00123WDR2/?tag=weea-20 ">camera</a>.</li>
<li>Court-Ben and I have a small cam that we try to remember to bring with us at all times. But that rarely, errr, never happens. Anyone who knows me knows I&#8217;m constantly snapping shots with my <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a>. Works for now and I always know I&#8217;ll have it on hand.</li>
