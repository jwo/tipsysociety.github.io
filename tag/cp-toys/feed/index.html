		<description><![CDATA[<p>My oldest son will be 3 in October and his current obsession is Cars 2. He knows what country the racers are from, what their numbers are, where the 3 races in the World Grand Prix take place, etc etc. So, we play with cars every. single. day.  Keeping that in mind I&#8217;ve been trying to come up something for his birthday.  I&#8217;ve got 3 different things in mind that are potential winners.</p>
<ol>

<li><a href="http://www.target.com/p/Disney-Pixar-Cars-2-Charge-Ups-Track-Set/-/A-13424262">Disney Pixar Cars 2 Charge Ups Track Set</a> (Target)- you charge up cars and then they race around the track on their own</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000A1ZF7/?tag=weea-20">Quercetti Super Marble Run Vortis</a> (Amazon)- or a marble run of some sort. The kiddo got to play with one of these in real life and dude was busy for a WHILE.</li>
