		<description><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/02/opinions-wanted/">Sarah posted</a> on whether or not she should get the iPhone or a Blackberry Bold.  I had been playing with the idea of switching from a Blackberry over to the iPhone myself.  My husband had already made that transition and was LOVING it.  So of course all your comments on the iPhone pretty much sealed the deal for me in terms of the iPhone.  Then I received one for Valentine&#8217;s Day!!  I thought I&#8217;d post some apps that are making my life a ton easier.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.groceryiq.com/groceryiq/index.html">Grocery iQ</a>&#8230;.DUDE this thing is crazy cool and I know I haven&#8217;t even used all the features.  On a basic level it&#8217;s just your regular shopping list.  However it does make things easier by grouping everything by the store aisles.  You can hook up your savings card to it for coupons&#8230;I haven&#8217;t gotten around to doing that just yet.  The BOMB thing about this app? My husband and I both have this installed on our respective iPhones and you can share one list.  So when he adds something, it shows up for me and vice versa&#8230;so whoever is out and about and able to pick something up at the grocery store they have the main list and can check the item off and it updates it for the other one.  SO TOTALLY COOL.  I know I sound super geeky&#8230;sorry, but I kinda am.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<h2>Blackberry Bold vs. iPhone</h2>
<p>So, my husband got an iPhone circa 2008 and I thought it was the most RIDICULOUS purchase ever. However, now that everyone, including my mother, has one, I&#8217;m starting to reconsider its coolness factor. The only thing I&#8217;m concerned about is the emailing capabilities and the touch keypad on the iPhone, which, I&#8217;m told, I will get used to, but the thing is that I really do use my blackberry for daily business emailing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to get a new phone within the next two weeks and I&#8217;m torn between these two phones. Remember, this phone will be used a lot for business.</p>
<p><strong>What phone will be best for my needs? </strong></p>
<p>(All thoughts and opinions greatly appreciated!)</p>
