		<description><![CDATA[<p>We all have them, you know, that one song that you absolutely HAVE to listen to when you&#8217;re on a road trip.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s our road trip songs, what are yours?</p>
<ol>
<li>AK, Pat Green &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000V66OM6/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Carry On</a>&#8220;: Oldie but goodie&#8230;my favorite line is &#8220;Billboards and Bullshit got her down&#8221;.  It&#8217;s one of those roll the windows down and blare it kinda songs.  Hopefully it&#8217;s sunny out.</li>
<li>Sarah, O.A.R &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00260US9A/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">That Was a Crazy Game of Poker</a>&#8220;: I CAN NOT get enough of this song and it&#8217;s perfect for road trips because it&#8217;s almost 9 minutes long! So basically, by the time you listen to it a few times (you know, to figure out all the words), you&#8217;re probably at least half way to your destination.</li>
<li>Melis, Hank Williams Jr. &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001D5IMC4/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Bartender Song</a>&#8220;: During one of my many years spent in college, a group of friends and I decided to take a road trip to Colorado. For some reason we listened to this song almost once an hour on that 20 hour drive, don&#8217;t ask me why. But now when I think road trip this song always comes to mind&#8230;</li>
<li>Court, Explosions in the Sky &#8220;<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/your-hand-in-mine/id318951781?i=318951791" target="_blank">Your Hand in Mine</a>&#8220;: This is actually not a roll your windows down sing along.  Its all instrumental and has lots of highs and lows.  Pretty EMO song, but I love it.  Ben introduced me to this band and it&#8217;s since been one of my favs.  I think I love listening to this song because its 9 damn minutes long and its great to listen to while reading or riding along.</li>
