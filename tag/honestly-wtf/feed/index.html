		<description><![CDATA[<p>Have you heard of this site? <a href="http://honestlywtf.com/">Honestly WTF</a> is a site I stumbled upon recently and I&#8217;m LOVING their DIY tutorials, specifically on bracelets.  The photo above are some of the ones that inspired me to get my craft on.</p>
<p><a href="http://honestlywtf.com/diy/diy-braided-hex-nut-bracelet/">DIY Braided Hex Nut Bracelet</a><br />
<a href="http://honestlywtf.com/diy/diy-rope-bracelet/">DIY Rope Bracelet</a><br />
<a href="http://honestlywtf.com/diy/diy-friendship-bracelet/">DIY Friendship Bracelet</a></p>
<p>Here is what I ended up with! They were pretty easy! The only ones that gave me a hard time were the rope bracelets, I could not wrap my head around how to tie that adjustable knot, but I finally got it right after several tries. The friendship bracelet, while it took a long time, it was pretty relaxing to sit and do while I watched Celebrity Rehab.  And you guessed it, I did not have rhinestones, but I did have turquoise beads (shocker).</p>
<p>The turquoise/green and shades of grey bracelets idea was found in the comments of Honestly WTF and you can find that tutorial <a href="http://www.iamvintagelover.com/diy-friendship-bracelets">here</a>. I can&#8217;t wait to figure out how to mix and match these with other bracelets I have.  What DIY stuff have you been doing recently?</p>
