		<description><![CDATA[<p>Ok you guys, I&#8217;ve been using Neutrogena Naturals Lip Balm for a couple of months now and it has turned out to <em>not</em> be my favorite, by far.  And this week my lips have been chapped, both figuratively and literally.  I tried upping my usage of Neutrogena Naturals Lip Balm to correct the problem, to no avail. On a whim I picked up <a href="http://shopping.aol.com/sally-hansen-daytime-lip-recovery/s239949966">Sally Hansen Daytime Lip Recovery</a>. You guys, I used this stuff once and BAM! Total RECOVERY!  It&#8217;s good stuff I tell ya!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>(Taboo subject ahead)</p>
<p>I was born with a lot of hair&#8230;especially on my head (which is good), but also when it came to &#8216;brows and my lip (which is not so good). Thankfully, my Mom recognized at en early age that it just wasn&#8217;t fair for her <span style="text-decoration: line-through">gorgeous</span> daughter to be walking around with a unibrow so I began getting my &#8216;brows and lip waxed at the tender age of 13&#8230;THANK YOU MOM!!!!!</p>
<p>I still go and get waxed every 6 to 8 weeks, but when life gets a little hectic, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000AAAVZE/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Sally Hanson Wax Strips</a> are the bomb! I only use them to keep my lip fuzz free, but you can also use them for any type of unwanted hair situation&#8230;then also hurt a lot less than the hot wax, which is another bonus.</p>
