		<description><![CDATA[<p>You need a new makeup brush? I got your makeup brush! I was in need of a new powder makeup brush and ran across this line called <a href="http://www.parispresents.com/EcoTools_s/70.htm">Ecotools</a> at my local Ulta store. I&#8217;m telling you, this is the softest brush I have ever owned.  I went out and bought a blush brush and eye shadow brush because I loved the powder one so much and I didn&#8217;t even need those other two.  In addition to them being as soft as a baby&#8217;s butt, they are also cruelty free, natural, made with recycled materials, have bamboo handles..I mean the list goes on people.  And they are definitely cheaper than the hoity toity ones I got at Nordstroms.</p>
