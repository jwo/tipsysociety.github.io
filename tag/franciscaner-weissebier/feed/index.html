		<description><![CDATA[<p>For all you beer lovers out there, this is a MUST try! Although I don&#8217;t know how to pronounce the actual name of this beer, my adorable nephew calls it &#8220;Fat Monk&#8221; because of the picture on the bottle.  This is a really smooth, light (in flavor, unfortunately not in calories), wheat beer, but who cares about calories when you&#8217;ve had a rough day and need a great drink!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the best way to drink it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Grab a glass.</li>
<li>Pour the beer into the glass until there&#8217;s about an inch of beer left in the bottom of the bottle.</li>
<li>Grab an orange slice and squeeze it into the beer.</li>
<li>Pour the rest of the beer into the glass (there is some type of yeast at the bottom of this beer that has a lot of yummy flavor).</li>
<li>Drink and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
