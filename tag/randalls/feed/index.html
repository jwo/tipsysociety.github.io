		<description><![CDATA[<p>You know you have a favorite cookie that you could eat a gagillion of if left to your own devices right?  We do too.  Here are ours.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sarah-I can take or leave a cookie, but <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/cooking-live/chocolate-peanut-butter-no-bake-cookies-recipe/index.html">these</a> are definitely a weakness of mine. For whatever reason, they only get made around the holidays and I can NEVER seem to get enough of them!</li>
<li>Court-<a href="http://www.greatamericancookies.com/sugar-p-136.html?cPath=31_32">Favorite cookie</a> EVAH.  So simple, so sweet.  This works out pretty well&#8211;since you can really only get these at the mall.  So I can say, bake a whole freaking dozen to my god damn self.  So, while at the mall, love to grab one of these.  My love for these has also been passed down to my son.  I am such a proud mom.</li>
<li>Melis-I admit I have absolutely no will power when it comes to cookies of any kind, which is why I don&#8217;t usually keep cookie dough at my house. But when I do make cookies, <a href="http://www.spunkmeyer.com/Our-Products/Fundraising-Products/Frozen-Cookie-Dough/Cranberry-Oatmeal-Cookies---44319/">Otis Spunkmeyer Cranberry Oatmeal</a> is always my first choice. They are just sweet enough to satisfy my craving without giving me a sugar overload. And with the oats and fruit in them I can pretend they aren&#8217;t quite as bad for me (yes, I know I am delusional&#8230;). And with the Otis Spunkmeyer frozen cookie dough, I can just pull out one or two cookies to bake at a time, so I don&#8217;t end up eating 2 dozen cookies one sitting.</li>
<li>AK-Chocolate Susans are only available at Randalls (a grocery store we have here in Texas).  I became addicted to these when all us Tipsy girls (minus Melis, add Der) worked together.  These cookies were a tradition for all birthdays or celebrations of some sort at work.  I generally have to avoid the cookie area at Randalls now so that I don&#8217;t start this addiction up again.</li>
