		<description><![CDATA[<p>On a whim, while I was browsing Barnes &amp; Noble* a few weeks back, I ran across these Sesame Street board books as a set called My First Library.  They were a HIT at my household.  Somebody who will remain nameless ran around our house yelling COOKIE! COOKIE! EGGO! OSSER!  So the other day I was in B&amp;N again and as I was walking out I saw they had a whole crapload of these My First Library sets in all sorts of themes.  And guess who is kicking herself for not buying the Toy Story one.  Stupid Stupid Stupid.</p>
