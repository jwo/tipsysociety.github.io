		<description><![CDATA[<p>This is called a bowlboard.  Pretty neato huh? I mean you know when you are making guacamole and you have all these little piles of jalapeno, onion, tomato, etc etc? And then you go to put all that on top of the avocado to mix and it gets stuck in all the crevices of your cutting board? Well this looks like it solves that problemo! And anything that gets that guac on my chip in my mouth in my BELLAY quick, I&#8217;m all for it.</p>
<p>(My husband, Jesse, is probably reading this right now, salivating over this new cutting board gadgetry&#8230;and if so, just know, I ordered one for you! It&#8217;ll be arriving shortly! And the birthday week continues! FTW!)</p>
