		<description><![CDATA[<p>PIE! Who doesn&#8217;t look forward to the pie at Thanksgiving?! Well we sure do! Â And these are the ones that make us salivate come Thursday of next week.</p>
<ol>
<li>AK-Cherry Pie-So I know all of you will probably be like what?! That&#8217;s not a Thanksgiving pie! Â Well see, the thing is, I&#8217;m not an all pie loving kind of person. Â I like two kinds of pie, cherry and apple. Â And to make things worse, I&#8217;m a crust snob. Â I only like pie that has been made with homemade crust.Â So generally my mother, the queen of pie making, will make me a cherry pie at Thanksgiving and at Christmas and this is the only time of year I have pie. Â Then she makes pecan pie or pumpkin pie for the rest of the fam.</li>
<li>Sarah-Buttermilk Pie-Like, AK, this is not your &#8220;typical&#8221; Thanksgiving pie; however, it&#8217;s the only dessert I look forward to during the holidays! (I&#8217;m more of a stuffing and mashed potato&#8217;s girl.) My MIL makes the BEST buttermilk pie I&#8217;ve ever had, and you can bet your a$# I will be fighting for multiple pieces of this bad boy on November 25.</li>
<li>Court-Cheesecake-This is definitely not even your typical pie, much less, Thanksgiving pie.Â  However; to clarify or even possibly to start a debate (bring it) a pie is anything with a crust and filling, so cheesecake is really in the pie family ðŸ™‚Â  Anywho, Ben&#8217;s Dad makes the best homemade plain cheesecake for many special occasions that have included Thanksgiving.Â  LOVE IT.</li>
<li>Der-Dutch Apple Pie-My favorite pie, Thanksgiving or not, is hands down Dutch apple pie. The brown sugary crumbly topping is Heaven on Earth I tell ya.</li>
