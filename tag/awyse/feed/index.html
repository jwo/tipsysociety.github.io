		<description><![CDATA[<p>So <a href="http://www.awyse.com/talkingcarl/TalkingCarl.html">this app</a> does nothing but cause silliness.  I&#8217;m warning you now.  I&#8217;m pretty sure my husband got this app for our son but I know WE ended up playing with it a lot more than our son did.  So here&#8217;s the gist&#8230;you talk to Carl and Carl repeats back what you say to him in a funky voice.  Very simple. I can&#8217;t tell you how wide eyed my son was listening to Carl repeat back what he would say to the iPhone.  It was hysterical!</p>
