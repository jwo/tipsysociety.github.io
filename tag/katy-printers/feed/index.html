		<description><![CDATA[<p>Us Tipsy gals threw our BFF <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/der/" target="_blank">Der</a> a fabulous (if I do say so myself) couples baby shower over the weekend, and we feel the need to share some of the details!</p>
<p>First up, the invitations&#8230;there were so many cute options out there, but we ended up going with one we found on Etsy by <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/pixelstixshop" target="_blank">pixelstixshop</a>. She had the JPEG already created, but used custom colors to match the decor of the shower (and the babies room)! After we had the JPEG in hand, we thought we would just have the invite printed on picture paper, but that turned out to be no bueno, so we went with a local <a href="http://www.katyprinters.com/" target="_blank">printer</a> that did a fantastic job and was really easy to work with&#8230;I mean, who doesn&#8217;t like to keep the local economy stimulated anyway!?!</p>
<p>Der loved the invitations and they ended up being the centerpiece for the rest of our decorations&#8230;stay tuned, more details to come!</p>
