		<description><![CDATA[<p>As AK mentioned in her <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/04/round-top-recap/" target="_blank">Round Top Recap</a>, we had an opportunity to try some wine from Miranda Lambert&#8217;s winery, <a href="http://www.red55winery.com/" target="_blank">Red 55</a>. Her wines are all  named after one of her fabulous, always playing on my i-pod, songs and I have to admit, the actual wine is GREAT!</p>
<p>Miranda&#8217;s Dad gave us a good overview of all of the wines, as well as ensuring us that the grapes are grown in Texas, so it&#8217;s always  nice to fall in love with something local. I haven&#8217;t been to the actual winery, but it&#8217;s located in Lindale, TX. and is on my list of locales to visit.</p>
<ol>
<li>White Liar: A smoothe and fruity Chardonnay.</li>
<li>County Road 233: A tastey Merlot. (I tried this one and it was in my top 2 of favorites for sure&#8230;I was also told this was Miranda&#8217;s fave as well!)</li>
<li>Crazy Ex Girlfriend: It&#8217;s classified as a &#8220;sweet white&#8221; wine, which would be right up Der&#8217;s alley if she wasn&#8217;t preggo&#8230;maybe this should be her after-baby gift!?!?!?!</li>
<li>Red 55: A cabernet sauvignon that I KICK myself for not trying&#8230;I was obsessed with this type of wine all winter!</li>
<li>Belle: This is a sweet red that I would compare to a shiraz for sure&#8230;</li>
<li>Kerosene: Similar to a pinot grigio, this was my other favorite&#8230;.it is really smooth and not as dry as other pinot&#8217;s that I&#8217;ve had&#8230;LOVE IT!</li>
<li>Electric Pink: A white zinfandel that, lets be honest, how do you go wrong with a white zinfandel!</li>
</ol>
<p>There is for sure a wine to suit all pallets in this group and this would definitely make a great, and fun, gift for someone. The wine can only be bought at the winery in Lindale, TX. and on the website, but Miranda&#8217;s Dad assured us he was working on getting it to us in stores soon! (I suggested Specs BTW, best liquor store in the state of Texas!)</p>
