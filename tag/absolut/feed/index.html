		<description><![CDATA[<p>We have our first The Tipsy Wedding Project update for you!!  We begin in pure Tipsy fashion with the drink that Christen chose.  If you&#8217;ll <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/05/hump-day-happy-hour-meets-the-tipsy-wedding-project/">recall</a> we gave our suggestions and then asked for yours.</p>
<p>Christen and Ed picked a madras to serve to their guests and decided to name it after one of the ideas our commenters threw at them, the &#8220;Fall in Love&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Madras</strong><br />
1 oz orange juice<br />
1.5 oz vodka<br />
3 oz cranberry<br />
garnish with an orange slice!</p>
<p>(served on the rocks in a cocktail glass)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the backstory Christen gave us on the drink decision:</p>
<blockquote><p>We started playing around with some of the recipes provided by you Tipsy gals, which was really fun, as you can imagine!  We&#8217;d mix up ingredients and try different combos, but never really hit on a clear choice.  Then I rememered how much I like the madras.  So I mixed one up for me, one for Ed and he agreed it was tasty!  We didn&#8217;t want something too girly-pink or too hardcore (like a martini) and this was a good medium.  The color was fun, we could easily garnish with an orange slice, and it was easy enough for the bartender to make in batches and serve up.  Winner!</p></blockquote>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5397" title="cr-hdhh gimlet" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/cr-hdhh-gimlet.png" alt="" width="500" height="334" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/cr-hdhh-gimlet.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/cr-hdhh-gimlet-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>1 1/2 oz. vodka</p>
<p>1 oz. Lime Juice</p>
<p>Stir all ingredients with ice, strain into a cocktail glass, and serve.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if it had to do with the amount of gimlets i consumed, but by the end of the night I was yelling and laughing GIMLET GRAVY repeatedly.  That might just be a side effect of the drink.   🙂</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The Tipsy Wedding Project with a twist so to speak.  For today&#8217;s Hump Day Happy Hour we are going to help Christen decide on a signature drink for her wedding.  She wants something vodka based, so all the Tipsy girls went in search of the perfect drink for the perfect wedding!</p>
<ol>
<li>Court-The 8 oz Twister:  2 oz Vodka, 2 oz Fresh Lime Juice, 2 oz Fresh Lemon Juice, 2 oz Pure Grape Juice.  I think this could be made on a large scale, since all parts are equal and just could pour in the highball glasses and BAM, Twisted.</li>
<li>Der-Cranapple Martini: 1 oz vodka, 1.5 oz. apple pucker and a splash of cranberry juice.  Both of those fruits make me think of fall and make me think this drink is probably delish. If I wasn&#8217;t with child, I&#8217;d be making one right now.</li>
<li>Sarah-Custom Drink, Name TBD:  1 oz. Vodka, 1.5 oz. Pomegranate Juice, 1 tsp elderflower liqueur, 1 splash of champagne, and garnish with an inexpensive fall flower that your florist can suggest for you.</li>
<li>AK-&#8220;Ed&#8217;s Last Name&#8221;-tini: 1 Shot Vodka, 1 Shot of Orange Juice, 1 Shot of Apple Juice, 1 Splash of Cranberry Juice.  Garnish with cranberries.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><span style="color: #000000">Directions: </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Pour all ingredients (chilled beforehand) into a large container or punch bowl filled with ice.   I think some of these <a title="Ice Lites" href="http://www.lightsforalloccasions.com/LiteCubes--Cube-MultiFunction-Blink-or-Constant-GREEN-274.aspx" target="_blank">Green Ice Lites</a> would be a great substitution for ice cubes, just sayin&#8217;.  Allow to chill.  Serve in punch cups or tall glasses.  Maybe something like <a title="Cups" href="http://www.twofunnygirls.com/detail_cups10.htm" target="_blank">these </a>would be fun!</span></p>
