I&#8217;m probably super late to this party but I was using a Revlon cheapo eyelash curler for years and at least for me it didn&#8217;t do much. I would see all over the place, CURL YOUR LASHES as part of your quick 5 minute makeup routine and I would think, man that doesn&#8217;t do anything for me. WELL. I decided to try out this one by Tarte and IT&#8217;S THE BOMB! It literally curls SO MUCH I can&#8217;t BELIZE it! It&#8217;s worth the cost, plus this one that I bought came with a little sample size mascara and I&#8217;m never one to turn down trying a new mascara.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">First of all, do not get the impression from the title of this product that I&#8217;m an ALL NIGHTER type of girl unless by that you mean my kids are not sleeping and I&#8217;m up all night in that kind of way. But I can promise you I am not wearing makeup while my kids are trying to stay up all night and suck my will to live out of me.  I originally bought this to try and set my makeup so it stays longer DURING THE DAY. I really only have time to apply my makeup first thing in the morning, so if I have dinner plans that night I don&#8217;t have time to start all over if my makeup has just melted off throughout the day. This stuff is pretty great because I can do my makeup first thing in the morning and spray a few sprays when I&#8217;m done and it really does set it for the day.</p>

I&#8217;ve had this store favorited on Etsy for a while and I just love all the fun colors.  I&#8217;m particularly drawn to all the dainty earrings, but they also have tons of other jewelry as well.  I think these would be a perfect mother&#8217;s day gift!</p>

These tennis shoes are THE BOMB. Initially I had purchased these for both of my boys but then I saw that they offered them in adult sizes too and now my husband and I both wear them as well. They have arch support unlike Converse, so they are super comfy in my book.  My husband also has been wearing them a ton and says they are the most comfortable tennis shoe he has aside from his workout tennis shoes.  The boys shoes have held up very well, my oldest wears his to school everyday and just keep on truckin. The best part of these shoes? ALL OF THE COLORS. SO MANY COLORS.<br />

As yall all know we live in Texas, Houston to be specific and we just had the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo happening out here. If you aren&#8217;t familiar with that, it&#8217;s about 3 weeks of mainly big name country artists performing in our big stadium after rodeo competitions. So anyway, my point, I promise I&#8217;m getting at it&#8230;its our time to dress in our fancy cowboy boots and hit the town. Normally when you are hitting up the rodeo you can count on having to do a lot of walking so I usually wear my comfy cowboy boots, the ones I KNOW won&#8217;t be killing my feet by the end of the night. This time around when Sarah and I hit up the George Strait concert I took a chance and wore some boots that were brand spankin new. Ridiculous right? Why would I do that to myself? Well let me tell you&#8230;these boots were THE. MOST. COMFORTABLE. boots! I mean you&#8217;d have thought I had worn tennis shoes! And the color of them ain&#8217;t too shabby!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Have you heard of <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/home">Fitbit</a>? It&#8217;s sorta like a pedometer in that it tracks your steps, but it does so much more than that.  My husband ordered Fitbits back in December for us. You wear the little tracker during the day as well as at night and it will track your steps, stairs climbed, calories, weight, and sleep.  There is an iPhone app that it works with where you can enter the food you eat throughout the day.  In addition they have a scale that syncs up with everything so you know your BMI.  You can set up weight loss goals and it will tell you what your calories should be for the day to lose weight by a certain period of time. You can also add how many glasses of water you&#8217;ve had.  </p>
<p>The MOST interesting aspect for me is how it tracks sleep. After having used the Fitbit for the last few months I have determined if I am awakened anytime between 12a and 2a I will definitely be dragging the next day.  If I somehow manage to not be awakened during that time I seem to be fine.  It&#8217;s quite interesting.  Here&#8217;s a bit of the data on me in case you are interesting in what the dashboard looks like.  </p>
<p><img src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ak-fitbit.png" alt="ak-fitbit" width="780" height="822" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9611" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ak-fitbit.png 780w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ak-fitbit-284x300.png 284w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p>I will tell you that night of sleep that I&#8217;m showing you in the picture&#8230;I was not just dragging the next day, I was downright grumpy.</p>
<p>For the record, Fitbit didn&#8217;t pay for any of this, we bought it ourselves. 🙂</p>
