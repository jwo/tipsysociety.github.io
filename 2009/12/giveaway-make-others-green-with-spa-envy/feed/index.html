		<description><![CDATA[I had the worlds worst skin experience...I was &quot;suffering&quot; from acne in college so I went to the derm and was referred to their aesthetician and told I needed a chemical peel and microdermabrasion at the same time.  That was mistake number one.  I went in and got the microderm first...felt nice, a little strange but no pain... Then the chemical peel...it felt like my face had been doused in gasoline, lit on fire and then more gasoline fanned the flames.  It was HORRIBLE.  I thought I would die.  I had to spend the next 3 days inside my home, away from the sun and covered in Vaseline because my skin was peeling so thick that each time a flake came off it was BLEEDING!  Certainly that might be the worst experience you&#039;ve ever heard.  XOXO.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[About 2 years ago, I found out I have endometriosis.  And despite a couple of surgeries, I had to take really strong hormones that wreaked havoc on my system and gave me terrible cystic acne.  That was really the icing on the cake after all the pain and emotional issues I had from the endo - I felt totally gross and unattractive.  I am on some new medication now, which helps a little, but at some point I will have to switch back to the other hormones!]]></description>
