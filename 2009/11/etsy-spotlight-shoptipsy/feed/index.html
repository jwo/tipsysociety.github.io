		<description><![CDATA[I will never get rid of my shade gray t shirt, because it&#039;s just perfect, it has the perfect lenght, every other t shirt i&#039;ve bought seems too short for me, barely covering below my tummy which i hate because i have to use layering shirts so that when i sit my butt doesn&#039;t show, and, i don&#039;t even have a big butt lol. This t shirt is perfect in lenght and i just love it because of that, and it&#039;s gray, for some reason i LOVE a t shirt in gray!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have a tie-dye t-shirt that I made in 6th grade. I&#039;m 30 years old and still wear it. It&#039;s been washed so many times it feels like silk. I LOVE it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ooh, I hope this contest is open for worldwide. 
I think it&#039;s probably my black tee with a mickey mouse print on it. The fabric is soft and thin (but not too thin) so it&#039;s so comfy to wear day in and day out. I love it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, that one is easy.  I have a tee that I bought at my first Tyler Hilton show.  It is one of the most comfortable shirts ever, it has an awesome silhouette of Tyler, and it doesn&#039;t hurt that his signed it for me. :D]]></description>
