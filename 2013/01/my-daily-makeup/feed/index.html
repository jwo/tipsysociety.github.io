		<description><![CDATA[I tried the brush with the cream blush and my mind is blown!  I think I was either wasting a lot of blush on my fingers OR putting on too much/rubbing too hard with my fingers.  Excellent tip!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ok that&#039;s what I was thinking it&#039;d be for....creasing and staying in place.  I mainly use primer all over because I read that it fills in fine lines and I damn sure need help with that!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Haha!  I started using it one summer when it was over 100 and I could barely get into my car without breaking into a sweat.  It&#039;s totally sheer, so it doesn&#039;t affect color one way or another, but I find it keeps my stuff IN PLACE all day and so the $3 tube is worth it in my opinion.  I just use it all the time now because sometimes I use a cream shadow and I find those crease more than others.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I also like the Dream Bouncy blush - I use Pink Frosting (which looks horrifyingly neon and isn&#039;t at all)!  I have recently switched up some of my routine - downsizing, actually, if you can believe it - but I&#039;m pretty loyal to these:

BeneFit Porefessional primer, maybe some tinted moisturizer but lately I&#039;ve been in a hurry!
ELF eyelid primer
Smashbox eyebrow powder (I have blonde spots that make me look like I only have half an eyebrow.  No joke.)
Mary Kay eyeshadow - either Honey Spice alone or Spun Silk with a little L&#039;Oreal Bronzed taupe over it
Mary Kay Mascara
Dream Bouncy Blush in Pink Frosting (I want to try the brush trick!) OR ELF blush in Candid Coral
Clinique Black Honey lip gloss

My name is Christen and have a product addiction.  (Hi Christen)]]></description>
