		<description><![CDATA[oh interesting! so the 3 way glaze is that like base and top coat or is it everything in one with the nail color too or what? I think I&#039;m going to for sure try the cooking spray and see how that does.  I&#039;m in need of longer finger nails before I go color yet but I might try it on my toes for now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I got some Essie 3-way glaze a while back and it seems to be the only way I can keep a manicure looking good beyond the 3 day mark. I&#039;ve never done the cooking spray trick, but I have a spray from Avon that does the same thing. It feels pretty similar to cooking spray, so I&#039;d guess it would work fine. The trick I&#039;ve found is to let the polish set for a few minutes, spray, wait another couple minutes and then gently smooth the nail surface with your fingers.]]></description>
