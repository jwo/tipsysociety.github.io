		<description><![CDATA[After Bare Minerals, I made a pit stop at Benefit Flawless - awesome because it &#039;s a fabulous powder with a poof, but acts like a concealer if you put it on with a sponge....but anyway, I am in LURVE with the BB Creams as well. I&#039;m using Maybelline Dream Fresh at the moment and it&#039;s GREAT. Clinique is coming out with a CC Cream - curious about that. I tried SuperGoop&#039;s CC Cream in my Birchbox last month and it was pretty good. I like to mix my BB with a bit of Estee Lauder Idealist Illuminator - glowy, not made up, and nice and even. Awesome.]]></description>
