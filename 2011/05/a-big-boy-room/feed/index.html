		<description><![CDATA[Thanks!! I definitely had that in mind when I did his nursery, to not make it too baby-ish so I could have it easily transition later on.  And I&#039;m a sucker for all the letters, you could probably tell huh? :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love that room!!  Themed kid rooms make me cringe since they&#039;re so temporary, and I love how so much of what you have can be used for years.  I think my favorite part is the mismatched letters on the walls (and also the shams).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you!!  You can read about the bed in my reply to Michelle M.  As for the chevron pillow covers I had them made by: http://www.etsy.com/shop/decoYellow I noticed she made regular size pillow covers so I asked if she&#039;d create some in a standard sham size and she was totally up for it!  I had my heart set on the navy chevron pattern so I was super thrilled that she was able to do these for me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you!!  I had the bed made by http://www.elpasoimportco.com/  Basically I took a picture of this bed: http://www.potterybarnkids.com/products/bennet-storage-bed/?pkey=dbeds-mattresses (for the bottom) and this bed: http://www.landofnod.com/kids-beds/kids-furniture/oak-park-elementary-bed/f4732 (for the headboard).  And I told them that I wanted the storage to fit those fabric bins like you can get at Target (which is where I got mine).  We love El Paso Import Co because they end up being way cheaper than some place like Pottery Barn and we could get exactly what we wanted made.  My favorite thing so far about the bins has been storing books for bedtime in one of them--SO CONVENIENT!]]></description>
