I actually like the look of the Payless ones better, more of a rounded toe.  Hopefully they come out with more colors soon.  As soon as my feet recover from being pregnant I&#039;ll have to get some.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[They do donate a pair! And I swear they feel the exact same way that Toms to on your feet. If I only saw these first! I may just have to get these too so I&#039;ll be donating two pairs... you know, just doing it for the less fortunate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I keep hearing about how comfortable Tom&#039;s are, but I wasn&#039;t willing to spend $45 to find out! Now that I know about the Payless version (Christina - they donate a pair too!) I&#039;ll be checking them out for sure. Thanks for sharing!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought the same thing about TOMS - they are ugly...but oh so comfortable, like walking on a cloud!  

At least with TOMS someone in need also got a pair, so something good came out of paying the extra money :)]]></description>
