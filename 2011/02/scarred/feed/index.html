		<description><![CDATA[I have the same issue with my skin.  I have become addicted to Lisa Eldgridge&#039;s blog (http://www.lisaeldridge.com/) particularly the videos about her favorite skincare products and sunscreens.  To minimize on the purple/reddish yuck that stays in place looong after the pimple dies, I&#039;ve started wearing sunscreen.  I used to never wear sunscreen either because it always made me break out like a banshee.  However I have fallen in love with La Roche Possay&#039;s sunscreen Anthelios 45 ultra-light fluid.  It truly does leave a matte finish on my wacky combo skin all day.  I also really love Kinara Lactic Acid Hydrating Serum.  I wash my face with origins checks &#038; balances face cleanser, because it does balance out everything a bit.  Then at night I use the serum from Kinara, with an eye cream (still searching for a good one), and in the a.m. I just use La Roche Possay&#039;s sunscreen.  Every 3rd day I use a cleanser with glycolic acid (I got one from The Red Door Salon &#038; love it but can&#039;t remember what it&#039;s called) or a combo with lactic acid like Dermologica&#039;s Skin Resurfacing Cleanser.  The combo of this with the daily use of the serum from Kinara has helped me immensely.  Not only has it helped with new breakouts, but it truly is evening out my skin and my scaring and spotting is disappearing quickly.  I&#039;ve been on this regimen for a couple of months but I did see a huge difference.  It was really pretty pricey to buy most of the products, but the only one I&#039;m even close to halfway thru is the sunscreen.  Everything else is lasting quite a long time and I don&#039;t expect to have to replenish my stock for quite a while.  I also did a lot of comparing online and found Amazon &#038; dermastore to be some of the less expensive places to buy skincare.  I would never have thought of amazon, but sometimes it was cheaper.  Sorry for the novel, I didn&#039;t intend on leaving but I hope it helps!]]></description>
