		<description><![CDATA[@MichelleG I would love to help you! Nothing I love more than giving my opinion, wanted or not :) I am often pained by the outfits I see on my professors (and some fellow grad students) so I totally understand where you are coming from. You can expect a post tomorrow morning with some ideas of what I would wear. Hope it helps!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[love the wedges- love love love them!! i&#039;m with you, once March hits i suddenly find myself drawn to all thinks nautical and crisp. 

ps: i know this is sort of an unusual request, but i&#039;m throwin it out there anyway. i&#039;m defending my graduate thesis on Thursday and can&#039;t decide what to wear. i want to look professional but not too dressy (and I&#039;m in Biology, so several members of the audience may or may not be wearing Burkenstocks with socks...). regardless, i know you&#039;re in grad school too AND i know you having amazing style sense. so.... any suggestions?   :o) 

thanks melis!]]></description>
