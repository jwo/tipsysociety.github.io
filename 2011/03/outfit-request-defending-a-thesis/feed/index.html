		<description><![CDATA[back with the official outfit report: woke up on the day of the defense to some serious snow on the round, so I went with a modified version of option #4! I have a similar top (though mine&#039;s teal), substituted the skirt for cream colored trousers, and nude pumps. :o) defense was a success and i felt well dressed for the occasion! thanks again melis!]]></description>

@MichelleG I was more than happy to help. Good luck with everything!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[(oops, I  think I meant option #3 for the yellow and brown belted dress).
@AK in my dream world where I am confident in any trend, I love that tie-neck dress! In real life, I think I would fidget with the bow and maybe feel too much of a 70&#039;s news anchor vibe (Christina Applegate in &quot;Anchorman&quot;, anyone?). 
@Haley, thanks for the tips! I&#039;m usually a bracelet girl so I&#039;ll be sure to pick something non-jingly like a cuff or something. :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ooooh, I&#039;m loving all these options! Leaning toward option #2: I love that soft, sunny yellow! And the cardigan would add a nice layer, since its not quite spring in the frigid Midwest. But, that green sheath dress from The Limited is gorgeous too, really simple but so striking and pulled together. Hmm... decisions, decisions. Thanks so much for the help Melis! I&#039;ll be sure to let you know what I went with! :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It sounds weird to call out, but make sure the jewelry you pick doesn&#039;t make noise and that you can&#039;t fidget and play with your clothes if you&#039;re nervous.  I sat through a presentation made by a women with a stack of of noisy bangles and another chick who could not stop messing with her skirt - it was very distracting!]]></description>
