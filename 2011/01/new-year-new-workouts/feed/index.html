		<description><![CDATA[@Danielle (elleinadspir): I won&#039;t say that you&#039;ll cry, but you&#039;ll definately get a good workout. And yes, you will find Jillian annoying after awhile, but my solution to that was putting her DVD on my laptop and watching TV while working out!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No, but don&#039;t kid yourself into thinking you&#039;ll graduate to level 2 in 10 days unless you&#039;re in good shape already.  And level 3 push-ups where you clap are just ridiculous.  It took me about 30 days to reach the second level, at which point I was getting bored with Jillian and switched to a boot camp DVD.  :)]]></description>
