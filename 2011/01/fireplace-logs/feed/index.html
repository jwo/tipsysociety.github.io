		<description><![CDATA[I went back and found the brand/style of what we got - Hargrove Rustic Timber (gaslogguys.com).  I don&#039;t think we ever saw ones that you could arrange yourself (and that would have intimidated me - and I might always be trying to adjust/perfect it).  Devon was SUPER picky about the look and these were the only ones that pleased him.  If you wind up near Waco anytime soon, you are welcome to come over and look.  In addition to the remote start (a definite plus) and &#039;platinum embers&#039; (you sprinkle them around and the glow brighter), some sets had pine cones you could add that hid knobs and such. Good luck!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very timely post Sarah...as I am investigating this too, during my remodel.  I am going to get the remote starter (apparently it adds around $500 to the cost of the logs to do this), but I think it will be well worth it.  My interior designer is checking into it for me and I will let you know what she comes up with!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[buy gas logs that look like real wood and that you can move around; meaning you can stack them any which way you choose! Also, get an assortment of short and long logs....I keep some in storage for a larger fire look and keep just a couple stacked on a day-in-day-out basis.  They should also come with a large bag of &quot;embers&quot; that you need to sprinkle under the logs.]]></description>
