		<description><![CDATA[It seems like a lot of you are wanting to learn to use your cameras!  I&#039;m not sure what you have available near you, but I live in Birmingham, AL, and both here and Atlanta, there is a lovely pair of women who have created Click workshops (www.clickworkshops.com - also on Facebook and Twitter), and they teach exactly how to use your cameras like professionals.  I bought a discounted class from Groupon and took it a few weeks ago, it was alarmingly simple to make a HUGE improvement in my photos.  They teach beginner and advance classes and also photoshop if you need it.  Contact me if you have other questions.  LOVE your site! - Katie]]></description>
