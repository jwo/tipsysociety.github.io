		<description><![CDATA[Definitely cheap!  I found all my great stuff at Big Lots, of all places.  Rods and hardware, too!  And I get compliments all the time!  Don&#039;t forget TJMaxx and Homegopds, either.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agreed.  Go cheap on the curtains and spend a little more on the hardware.  I actually found some lovely curtains from IKEA for my bedroom that I adore and they were dirt cheap.  I didn&#039;t even spend all that much on hardware from JC Penney.  The way I think of it is this - I won&#039;t be spending that much more time in my current house, and curtains stay with the house - so why spend a lot of $$?  If you are in your dream home, then I would maybe spend a little more.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Get the cheapos!  Although the two you posted weren&#039;t that different in price.

I had a hard time finding curtains that were inexpensive AND met all my requirements (bright blue and room darkening) I needed for my sons room.  I ended up finding some really nice, and inexpensive, ones at Walmart (after searching for over a year...and making a lot of returns).  I just can&#039;t fathom spending that much on curtains, when places like Target and Walmart have some good quality ones for a pretty good price.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My $29.99 (each) Target window panels work great.  They&#039;re as thick as blankets and block a lot of light.  I dont think any window panel is worth $8 unless the pattern is to die for.]]></description>
