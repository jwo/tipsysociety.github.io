		<description><![CDATA[@L Dubya The only thing about the ones that I found that you might not want to put them in the fridge is that they have a slight lavender fragrance.  I don&#039;t know if all of them have that or just the ones that I bought.  So you might check to see if there are non fragranced ones.  They are definitely small--like two inches in diameter so they&#039;d be perfect for small spaces.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do you see any reason why you can&#039;t use these in the fridge/freezer? I always keep a container of baking soda in both but it&#039;s an open container and can easily spill. These would be great to just throw in the back and forget about.]]></description>
