		<description><![CDATA[Now that is clever - I love the storage in the arm!  I think it would be great for a study, where it won&#039;t get tons of wear (Ikea couches tend to look abused after a while, in my experience).  

I don&#039;t watch G&#038;B, but I saw her on a talk show and felt bad for her.  She is sooooo thin and clearly has body issues, which aren&#039;t cured by having a hottie husband who loves you.  They were saying she probably could have a baby if she let her weight rise to a normal range but that would mean bad press and unflattering photos in tabloids.  So sad... :(]]></description>
