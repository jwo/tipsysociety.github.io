		<description><![CDATA[I could have written this same post a year or so ago. My son is nearly 18 months now but oh how I have not forgotten these days. And the DD coffee and iPhone are still representing! 

I nursed and pumped for 13 months and felt like I may have had a closer relationship with Medela than with my husband during this time. Ha!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am with you on the iPhone... I have a 5 mo. old and have said to my friends numerous times that it saved my sanity!  I mean the HOURS spent in the dark, nursing... what did women DO before this??!  (and esp. love that my Kindle syncs with my iPhone.  I&#039;ve read more books since I&#039;ve had her than before, even if I do most of my reading at 2am :)]]></description>
