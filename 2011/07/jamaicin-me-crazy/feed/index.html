Just an update--the main attractions we visited were the Falls.  LOVED it.  Thank you so much for that suggestion.  Also, the snorkeling was great.  Thanks for the suggestions ladies.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[how exciting COURT! a couple super fun things to add to your list:

(1) bioluminescent bay (i have been to Luminous Lagoon at Glistening waters- 876-954-3229) SUPER, super cool and fun. basically, there are tiny microorganisms that live in the water in this bay and they glow in the dark when the water is disturbed. you have a meal at sunset by the water, then at dusk you take a boatride into the bay and can swim in the water. the wake of the boat glows and twinkles like glitter and if you run your hand through the water, it sparkles like a million stars in the water. its really incredible, and there are only a few places like it in the world!

(2) Dunn&#039;s River Falls- basically, some beautiful water falls coming down the side of a hill/mountain. their are trails along the falls that you can hike up, and the more adventurous can climb up the falls themselves. there are places along the way where the water pools and you can swim. super fun!

(3) do #5 on your list 24/7! is it just me, or do complimentary drinks on vacation just taste better than the regular old kind? bring on the margaritas and pina coladas!  :) 

hope you have a great time!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been snorkeling, and something about the possibility of things nibbling on my toes creeps me out. Ditto for item 2, although if I could get past that, it would probably be awesome. I&#039;m all over 3-5. Especially 4 &#038; 5.
That place is GORGEOUS! Which one is it?]]></description>
