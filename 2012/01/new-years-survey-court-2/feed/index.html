		<description><![CDATA[@Amanda:  good to know I have some options.  I seriously don&#039;t know what I will do whenever I run out.  There is still a ways to go.  

Yes, guilty as charged on the new DCFC release.  Right now I have Keys and Codes (Remixes) on continuous loop at work.  

Happy New Year to you too.  I have a feeling this year is going to be great!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Once you run out of Law &#038; Order (like I have, LOL), I moved on to Criminal Minds and Without a Trace. It&#039;s good to be prepared. ;)
Not a peep about this year&#039;s DCFC release? Surely something quotable from that? 
Happy New Year!]]></description>
