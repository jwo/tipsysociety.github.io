		<description><![CDATA[@Christine I&#039;m really fair as well and I never remember to mix the tanner in..I&#039;m actually afraid of using tanner on my face. I&#039;m always afraid I&#039;ll look all crazy because I didn&#039;t blend it right or I&#039;ll break out. Do you like the Clarins?  I&#039;ve used Jergens for the rest of my bod.

Anybody else doing the moisturizer/tanner thing?  What are you using?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You had me at moisturizer....I am a little obsessed.  I am a HUGE believer in Cetaphil face wash for oily skin.  I think it&#039;s better than any other brand.  I was using kiehl&#039;s moisturizer, but needed to go easier on my wallet, so now I use Neutrogena: one for night and one for day. (the ones with antioxidants)  I also use their alpha hydroxy eye cream and their retinol treatment.  I know....I have a problem...BUT I don&#039;t have crow&#039;s feet!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with Court on the Cetaphil. And for not being a soapbar fan, I actually really like their antibacterial soap bar for my face. I keep it in a little plastic container with a lid and it last for months. Paying less than $3 is a bonus!]]></description>
