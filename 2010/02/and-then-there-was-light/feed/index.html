		<description><![CDATA[I KNOW! Love, love Restoration hardware, but the prices KILL ME! (I will shamefully admit that I forked over a lot of cash for some of their bedding.) However, I was in the same boat with the recent white sale...I opted for PB towels too!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of course I love #2.  Why do you dangle the Rest.Hard. carrot,  lady?  Argh! I bought towels there during their white sale, thinking I scored a deal. Then I went to Pottery Barn&#039;s white sale and got more towels for way less money.  I felt so foolish for returning the towels to RH. They asked why and I said I found a better sale.  The sales lady was all &quot;But are they 800 thread count towels?&quot; Ummmmm, no....sheesh!]]></description>
