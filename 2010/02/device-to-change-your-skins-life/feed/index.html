		<description><![CDATA[@Tracy: Thanks for the suggestion and for reading the Blog!

I know there are a lot of different types of the Clarisonic that vary in price. I have the Clarisonic Plus, which retails for $225, but my Mom found it onlne for $125, I think. So glad to know the word is spreading about these things!!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,  Just wanted to say that I&#039;m a new reader but I truly enjoy reading this blog!  Ok - onto the Clarsonic...my dermatologist recommended that I start using this and I&#039;m totally hooked!  I absolutely love it and not a day goes by that I don&#039;t use this thing!  I bought my off the internet for considerably cheaper than what Sephora sells it for so check out some of the online stores before running out and buying it at the mall!]]></description>
