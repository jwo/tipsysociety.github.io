		<description><![CDATA[@valerie....another story about cats (re:crazy cat lady), my stepcatson, Ozzie loves to position himself in what I lovingly call a choke hold.  This happens generally around 5-6 am on weekends.  This is his favorite position for me and I love him too much to push him off.  

#5 does look like the bomb.  But again, will they deem it worthy?  Keep me posted ladies!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No matter what, (and this usually happens after I am asleep) Mr. Kitty ends up under the covers in the crook of my arm.  Although I love to snuggle with him I have had to make more trips than I would like to admit to the chiropractor because this position kills my back.  Now if that isn&#039;t sacrificial love than I don&#039;t know what is!  I want No. 5 for our den to replace his ugly scratching postâ€¦wonder if he would actually use it of deem it unworthy.]]></description>
