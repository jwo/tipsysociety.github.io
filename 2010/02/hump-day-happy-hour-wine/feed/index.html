		<description><![CDATA[I like ice wines for a dessert option that isn&#039;t sickly sweet.  Jackson-Triggs is a crowd pleaser.  Cakebread is good but the prices have shot up recently; however, their Chardonnay usually pleases even the biggest red wine snobs.  Honig Sauvignon Blanc is fabulous, too.  Not sure if they have made their way out there since they are a smaller, newer Napa winery.  (Yeah, we&#039;re spoiled living here since half the state is &quot;wine country&quot;)  If we&#039;re going for budget-friendly, Yellow Tail is a great option (reds and whites and they even have a sparkling version if you are craving bubbly!), but you can get that anywhere.  Wow, I am outing myself as a total wino...

When in doubt/overwhelmed, I ask the resident expert at our store: she is adorable and always takes time to offer up new suggestions.  I feel like I should invite her over for dinner at this point!]]></description>
