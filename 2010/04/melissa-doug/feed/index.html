		<description><![CDATA[@Danielle Good to know about the sushi set!!  I have had the exact same experience with the pet sounds...we have farm animals and pet sounds and lost the piece that goes to the gerbil or whatever that animal is...and when we turn out the lights in the living room at night it makes the little gerbil sound.  It freaked me out too!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We have the sushi set, among lots of the other food sets, love it all. So fun and durable. The pizza and the sushi are my son&#039;s favs. I had to get rid of the pet sounds puzzle...it would randomly make sounds (I guess when the light in that room changed) but it freaked me out!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My son had the Frog (number 6) and people were ALWAYS asking us where we got it.  I love their products.  Also...little tip....Ikea.  No, really. They make some really cool toys.  I hated all the little walking push wagons out there.  Ikea&#039;s was sleek and so cute I paid to have it shipped from Austin because you couldn&#039;t order it online.  They have very cute wooden toys that are very cheap!]]></description>
