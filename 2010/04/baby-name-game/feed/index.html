		<description><![CDATA[That is the exact conversation we had....VERBATIM.  Before we found out the gender, it was worse.  Thank the powers that be we had a boy because my husband thought he was a Von Trapp.  His choices for a girl were: Bronwyn, Bridget and Gretchen.  Seriously....
He was NO help for boy&#039;s names AT ALL.  I finally narrowed it down to 2 that he didn&#039;t gag at.  My poor tot went without a name for several days until I just decided for both of us.  
Out of all of those books, I thought the Baby Name wizard was the BOMB!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ha!  I think I could totally picture him saying that.  We&#039;re going with the &quot;junior&quot; route, so we lucked out and never had to think of a name.  Good luck!  Anything you pick will be just right.  :)]]></description>
