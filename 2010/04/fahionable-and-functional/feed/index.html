		<description><![CDATA[@Sarah: True story.  When they&#039;re good, they&#039;re great and when they&#039;re slow it&#039;s a nightmare.

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, they are notorious for that, I learned after reading so many things on them after our experience. I mean for furniture its almost unavoidable--but if its a smaller item like a chair that can go into the bed or back of a truck/suv, I would say send it to the store.]]></description>
