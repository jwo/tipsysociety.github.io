<div class="post-info"><span class="date published time" title="2010-12-30T10:00:38+00:00">December 30, 2010</span>  by <span class="author vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="../../../author/der/index.html" rel="author">der</a></span></span>  </div><div class="entry-content"><p><strong>1. What did you do in 2010 that you’d never done before?</strong></p>
<p>Birthed a bouncing baby boy! Ouch.</p>
<p><strong>2. Did you keep your new year’s resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</strong></p>
<p>You know, I typically don&#8217;t make resolutions mainly because I don&#8217;t keep them. I am making some BIG ones for 2011 though.</p>
<p><strong>3. Did anyone close to you give birth?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Do I count?? What about me! Um, there were babies everywhere in 2010 and apparently that will also hold true for 2011. Bring on the babies!!</p>
<p><strong>4. Did anyone close to you die?</strong></p>
<p>My brave father in law passed away recently after a long battle with cancer. I am forever grateful that he was able to meet our son. He was admirable in so many ways and we miss him every day.</p>
<p><strong>5. What countries did you visit?</strong></p>
<p>Um, none. Same answer as last year. I spent the entire year preggers, so there was very little traveling.</p>
<p><strong>6. What would you like to have in 2011 that you didn’t have in 2010?</strong></p>
<p>A waistline.</p>
<p><strong>7. What dates from 2010 will be etched upon your memory, and why?</strong></p>
<p>February 6th, 2010.. the day I found out I was expecting AJ.</p>
<p>March 18th, 2010&#8230; the first time I laid eyes on my little gummi bear.</p>
<p>June 20th 2010&#8230;. I saw a tiny weenie.. not the dog variety. It&#8217;s a boy!</p>
<p>October 7th, 2010&#8230;the day we welcomed our precious son into the world.</p>
<p><strong>8. What was your biggest achievement of this year?</strong></p>
<p>Bringing another life into the world. Beat that. Haha.</p>
<p><strong>9. What was your biggest failure?</strong></p>
<p>dude, this question is so hard. I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m trying to stay positive here&#8230;not trying to force on some depression or something.</p>
<p><strong>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</strong></p>
<p>morning sickness sucks donkey balls.</p>
<p><strong>11. What was the best thing you bought?</strong></p>
<p>I would have to say baby gear. There seems to be a theme with all my answers.</p>
<p><strong>12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</strong></p>
<p>My husband&#8217;s. He put up with some mega mood swings, emotional breakdowns, financial changes and losing his father all while prepping for the biggest gig he ever took on.. being a daddy. I&#8217;m so proud of him and what he does for our family.</p>
<p><strong>13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna take the high road.</p>
<p><strong>14. Where did most your money go?</strong></p>
<p>Baby, baby stuff&#8230;thankfully not to doctors or hospitals because apparently being a fireman has perks in insurance, not paychecks.</p>
<p><strong>15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?</strong></p>
<p>Finding out the sex of my child. I couldn&#8217;t sleep for days prior. Oh, and of course his birth. That&#8217;s a story that I&#8217;ll save for another day, but man was it exciting! Like the movies kind of exciting.</p>
<p><strong>16. What song will always remind you of 2010?</strong></p>
<p>Teenage Dream by Katy Perry. I LOVE that song, specifically the Glee version.</p>
<p><strong>17.</strong> <strong>Compared to this time last year, are you: a) happier or sadder? b) thinner or fatter? c) richer or poorer?</strong></p>
<p>Infinitely Happier&#8230;.babies have that effect on you.</p>
<p>Fatter.. .again babies tend to have that effect on you.</p>
<p>Poorer&#8230;  again with the babies.</p>
<p><strong>18. What do you wish you’d done more of?</strong></p>
<p>Looked around, enjoyed time with friends and family. I feel like I looked up and the year is over.</p>
<p><strong>19. What do you wish you’d done less of?</strong></p>
<p>Worry, everything always works out the way it’s supposed to&#8230;I&#8217;m gonna keep the same answer as last year on this one. I really do need to stop the worrying.</p>
<p><strong>20. How did you spend Christmas?</strong></p>
<p>With family at several different houses. The hubs worked so, that was a bummer.</p>
<p><strong>21. Did you fall in love with 2010?</strong></p>
<p>Sure, why not. It had some super duper good times, but there were several major lows too. Overall I would say definitely a year to remember.</p>
<p><strong>22. What was your favorite TV program?</strong></p>
<p>Modern Family, Private Practice and Glee</p>
<p><strong>23. Do you hate anyone now that you didn’t hate this time last year?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t hate anyone. Ever. But this year sure did test that in a real big way.</p>
<p><strong>24. What was the best book you read?</strong></p>
<p>Belly Laughs by Jenny McCarthy and Knocked Up by Rebecca Eckler (hey! I did read this year!)</p>
<p><strong>25. What was your greatest musical discovery?</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I discovered anything musical this year, but I sure do dig the glee soundtracks.</p>
<p><strong>26. What did you want and get?</strong></p>
<p>A baby. And a third weiner dog.</p>
<p><strong>27. What did you want and not get?</strong></p>
<p>I think I got everything I wanted. Ok, maybe not a new car&#8230;but I&#8217;ll take a bambino over a car anyday.</p>
<p><strong>28. What was your favorite film of 2010?</strong></p>
<p>I honestly can&#8217;t remember the names of any movies right now. So, I&#8217;m guessing none of them made that big of an impression.</p>
<p><strong>29. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</strong></p>
<p>I turned 26 and all my Tipsy gals, family and friends threw me my first ever surprise party and it was weiner dog themed!</p>
<p><strong>30. </strong><strong>What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</strong></p>
<p>I would have to say that this year was pretty satisfying on it&#8217;s own. It doesn&#8217;t need any help.</p>
<p><strong>31. How would you describe your personal fashion concept of 2010?</strong></p>
<p>More casual than ever before.. between maternity wear and post partum, I didn&#8217;t stand too much of a chance fashion-wise.</p>
<p><strong>32. What kept you sane?</strong></p>
<p>My husband. He really does know how to reel my ass in when I get a case of the crazies.</p>
<p><strong>33. What political issue stirred you the most?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t do politics.</p>
<p><strong>34. Who did you miss?</strong></p>
<p>I missed seeing my friends regularly for adult evenings. I think those went down drastically with all the preggos we got running around.</p>
<p><strong>35. Who was the best new person you met?</strong></p>
<p>Aiden James, my son. I&#8217;m gonna go on record and say the best person I&#8217;ve ever met. Ever.</p>
<p><strong>36. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2010.</strong></p>
<p>Everything happens for a reason. It really and truly does.</p>
<p><strong>37. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be like this for long&#8221; Darius Rucker</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s so lovely to read how much you love being a mama!  AJ is so lucky to have you.  My deepest sympathies on losing your father-in-law.  I&#8217;m sure his great spirit lives on in your husband and little one!</p>
