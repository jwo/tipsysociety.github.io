		<description><![CDATA[These are great! I&#039;ve been on the hunt for useful stocking stuffers, as we&#039;re hosting my sister and her husband who are in the middle of a cross-country move, and I know any dumb trinket they won&#039;t use will just get left at my house! I love that wristband (what better for people moving into a new apartment?) and the mints (perfect for the long car trip!). And who wouldn&#039;t love a few more additions to their iTunes playlist??]]></description>
