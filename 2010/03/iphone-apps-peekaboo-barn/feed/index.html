		<description><![CDATA[@Kyla it&#039;s called BabyApps: Dial-a-phone however it doesn&#039;t disable the home button hahaha! And I know exactly what you mean about that, I totally wish something like that would happen. I&#039;m pretty sure the uh ohs over here are on purpose and its because he&#039;s tired of playing that game and wants to figure out how to call 911 or txt or email someone on my behalf!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ooo!! A pretend phone for the phone! Which one is that one? I think my youngest would love it. 

I wish they would make something to disable the home button while the little ones are playing though. My youngest always hits the home button and says &quot;Uh oh!&quot; then throws the phone back at me expecting me to restart the game for her. After about 10 minutes of &quot;Uh oh&#039;s&quot; and getting hit with the phone I end up calling it a day and putting the phone away. Actually, I think that one is her favorite game out of all of them and it only cost me about $20 in kid apps. :p]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Kyla hahaha that is too funny!  the kiddo apps are growing believe me...and I JUST got Wheels on the Bus today!  So I&#039;m definitely going to check out your other suggestions.  Peekaboo also has a Peekaboo Wild and its like lions and hippos and stuff.  I also have an app that is a pretend keypad for a phone and makes ringing noises--so that&#039;s been a big hit as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love that app! If you are anything like me your phone has more apps for your kiddos than it does for you. Some of my fav kid &lt;strike&gt;tamers&lt;/strike&gt; games are AniMatch, Animal Show, and anything by Duck Duck Moose (Itsy Bitsy, Old Macdonald, Wheels on the Bus). They are perfect for waiting in Dr offices, at the grocery store, or pretty much anywhere I drag the girls. I can&#039;t even get my phone out these days without them fighting over who gets to play first. (I&#039;m ashamed to admit that I sometimes sneak away to the bathroom to get my Facebook /Blog updates when I am around the girls - I&#039;m pretty sure they are on to me though)]]></description>
