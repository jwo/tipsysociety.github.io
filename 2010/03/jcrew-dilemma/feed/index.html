		<description><![CDATA[My beef with JCrew, other than the ever-rising prices for bsics, is that some of their stuff doesn&#039;t hold up.  A couple of cashmere sweaters look a little ragged and I can assure you that I treat them like they are my babies.  Disappointing.  I love the places like H&#038;M and Forever 21 and Target come up with affordable knockoffs!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have so much sadness in my heart over J Crew....over the past few years they&#039;ve continued to make the same awesomely adorable clothes, but why would I pay that much (even if I wanted to) for the same things that cost 1/3 or more less just 3 or 4 years ago? (I&#039;m thinking their t-shirts for that example)

		<description><![CDATA[Story of my life... maybe one day I&#039;ll be rich enough to shop there.  :(

Martin &#038; Osa is a good substitute, but they&#039;re going out of business in July.  After that, I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m going to do.  I have real trouble paying more than $20 for a tank top of any kind.]]></description>
