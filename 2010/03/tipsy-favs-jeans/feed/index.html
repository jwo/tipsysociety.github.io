		<description><![CDATA[@ Court they do make ankle lenth with a 30&quot; inseam in the Long &#038; Lean so you should be fine! Plus, I would almost say they run big so you get to go down a size and feel skinny for a while. ;)  

I&#039;m not a big fan of rips and fading so I was thrilled to find a uniform dark wash that Stacy and Clinton would not burn if they saw them on me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@amanda....I think the AGs would be a great investment.  I have a hard time letting go that amount of money on jeans--but from what alot of these comments are showing, its worth the investment because they will fit better and last long.  

My butt is entirely too large to American Eagle, but know alot of people who go their for their denim.  Thanks for the input, its greatly appreciated!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Right now, my favorite jeans are a pair of boyfriend cut AG&#039;s. Of course, since I carry my weight in my hips and thighs, they actually just fit me normally instead of loose and baggy. LOL. I have one pair of tailored Banana Republic ones that I use if I want to wear &quot;jeans&quot; to the office, and the rest are American Eagle. Skinny and bootcut, different colors and washes. The waist is just high enough, the price is OK, and they&#039;re cut for 15 year olds, so they pack my saddle bags in *just right* without much stretch to highlight them. 
I haven&#039;t had a pair of Gap jeans in awhile, but they&#039;re always great!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Haley man I really need to try those, you aren&#039;t the first person I&#039;ve heard talk about how great the Long &amp; Lean jean is.  I hate jeans shopping, with a passion, but I think I need to haul my ass &amp; thighs over to the Gap and try those on!  I&#039;ll do anything for a jean that makes me look like I&#039;ve lost weight!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@ Haley...your post on those jeans is just as hilarious as it is AWESOME.  We need to hook up when we shop, as last time I check, I was also not a size 14!

I do own one pair of Long and Lean and I&#039;m 5 foot.  They are pretty old, so I don&#039;t always bring them out.  Should I go try a new pair?  Do they have them in short?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I looooove the Gap Long &#038; Lean jeans.  Contrary to what the name may lead you to believe, they have legs wide enough to accommodate a thigh and make me look like I lost weight.  And they don&#039;t come pre-ripped or faded unless you want them to.

Here&#039;s a post I wrote about them when I had my jeans shopping breakdown:  http://cardiganjunkie.blogspot.com/2010/01/but-i-dont-want-skinny-jeans.html]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@ ak: Give them a whirl and report back!  The ankles aren&#039;t too tapered, so that sold me.  Less 1987 as far as I was concerned.  :)]]></description>
