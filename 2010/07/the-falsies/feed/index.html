		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve tried this but I&#039;m still a LashBlast girl (CG took me away from my $20 a tube mascara habit and I&#039;ve not looked back). This was goody but pretty goopy- also, isn&#039;t the look a total rip-off of the CoverGirl packaging?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I recently tried this, too, and am very impressed with it. The only bad thing I&#039;ve noticed is that you need to really wipe the brush off on the rim of the bottle before applying it - otherwise it goes on really goopy. It washes off easily with just facial soap and water - no major oily remover needed.]]></description>
