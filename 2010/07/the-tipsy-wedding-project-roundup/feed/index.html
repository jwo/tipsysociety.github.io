		<description><![CDATA[Aw, thank you!  This was such fun and truly did help us narrow down all the crazy options out there, and I can&#039;t wait to share photos.  I think you will be surprised by just how many ideas we incorporated!  We&#039;re getting ready to send out the invitations and finalizing details.  Tomorrow we head to the courthouse to apply for our marriage license!

Thank you for your wonderful suggestions and a big THANK YOU to the readers who voted.]]></description>
