		<description><![CDATA[I went and purchased this product after seeing it here and oh boy am I sold after one use!  Last night I sprayed it on my hair after my shower and let it air dry while I slept (my usual routine.)  Oh boy is my hair full today and so soft.  It is the perfect product for my fine, limp hair.  Thank you so much for posting about Wool Shake so that it crossed my radar!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I tried this out now for 2 days in a row and I am 100% sold. It gives my slick hair a huge boost of volume and just the right texture to manipulate into lots of cute styles. I used on my roots before drying, straightened my hair after drying and then lifted small sections around the crown and sprayed some more. Best new hair product I&#039;ve tried in a while! Good find Sarah!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is to add volume to your hair...It can be used on wet or dry hair. If you have curly hair and apply it when wet it should help give volume, but help control curls. If you apply to dry hair it should make it fuller, and for a someone with fine hair it will help keep them from needing to backcomb their hair as much.  Can also control curls and pump up volume on dry hair...if you have natural curls.]]></description>
