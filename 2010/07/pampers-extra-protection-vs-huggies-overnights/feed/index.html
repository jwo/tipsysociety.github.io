		<description><![CDATA[I was obsessed with diapers last month. We had always used the Huggies Overnights and when they leaked we just went up a size....then we went to the nighttime pull ups...but...they stop at 3T-4T. The daytime ones go to 4T-5T...why do the daytime ones go bigger than the night!?!? Aren&#039;t most kids in pull ups longer at night than during the day!?!?! OMG I was so anoyed (an you tell?). Anyway...so now we use the GoodNites ones.]]></description>
