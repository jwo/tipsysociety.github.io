		<description><![CDATA[I hadn&#039;t really thought about Bullseye not speaking... 

As for my 3-year-old&#039;s favorite movies, Toy Story 1 &#038; 2 are favorites, followed closely by Nemo. Except when the diver shows up - he makes us fast forward through that scene.

I want to take him to see 3 in the theater, but the husband is concerned it might be a bit much. We&#039;ll see... You&#039;re right, though, it&#039;s a kids movie. Plus, they always have the volume up so high in those things, you probably wouldn&#039;t notice anyway!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh - maybe I&#039;ll get Ice Age. I hadn&#039;t even thought about that one. I bet it&#039;s a good choice. After I read your post and commenting,  B started retelling Cars to me yet again. So I wrote out his account and posted it. Too funny. Maybe I can get a full set of &quot;Disney as told by a 3 year old&quot; soon. Can&#039;t wait to hear how your in theater experince is. We haven&#039;t been brave enough to try that yet!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ak, I knew you were doing this post today, but I didn&#039;t know we were into deep questions about Bullseye.

Me and Aus ALWAYS wanted to know that.  I thought it was because the other animals had a role and were funny talking.  Whereas Bulleye&#039;s roll was to be loyal to Woody.  So really what would Bullseye say if he could.  Aus had even more theories that involved conspiracy of sorts...

Heres what wiki said: Bullseye acts like a dog in many ways. Unlike most of the other toys, Bullseye cannot communicate in clear speech but sounds like an actual horse, he uses &quot;body language&quot; to &quot;speak&quot;. According to a character interview that use to be up on the early 90&#039;s Toy Story website, Bullseye communicated with Jessie while in storage by tapping his hooves to yes or no questions]]></description>
