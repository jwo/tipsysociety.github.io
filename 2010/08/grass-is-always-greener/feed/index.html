		<description><![CDATA[Emma Watson recently cut her hair and looks awesome!

I had a pixie when I was about 20/21 and liked it.  I was in school in Washington and my hair would just balloon out and frizz in the rain so this was easier for sure.  It was easy to maintain but a pain when I decided to grow it out.  I think it&#039;s a chic look.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I LOVE them too, but I&#039;ve had a pixie twice in my life.  Both times I kept it up for about a year.  For some reason though I am afraid to get one again, even though I REALLY want one.  I guess I&#039;m afraid of what it will look like with the extra pregnancy weight...]]></description>
