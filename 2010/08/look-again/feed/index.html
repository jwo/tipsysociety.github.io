		<description><![CDATA[I have 3 of the largest sized Starbucks acrylic cup - I work on Michigan Ave. in Chicago, so there are 2 Starbucks within a block - I stocked up!  One for my desk at work, one for my water at home, and one in case the dishwasher doesn&#039;t get run on any given night.  Can&#039;t be without one!  My coworkers became so jealous that they ran out to get their own - now we have a brigade of about 8.  Fashionable, sustainable, and fun!]]></description>
