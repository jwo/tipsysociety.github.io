		<description><![CDATA[I tried this and learned that J. Crew wedding dresses can run a bit small, so be sure you call and talk to bridal advisor and get the right size.  I ordered the same size JCrew dress I&#039;m wearing right now and couldn&#039;t come close to zipping it up.  However, my local store was great about taking the return and it was so easy.  

I agree that traditional dress shopping is not magical and fun.  What other time do you purposely try on expensive things that are the wrong size and then decide to buy it anyway?   :)]]></description>
