		<description><![CDATA[@MichelleG Thanks for the support! The peony lip shimmer is not as dark as it looks in the pic, I promise. It goes on a lot lighter. I like it because it goes on just slightly darker than my natural lip color. The watermelon color is also a good one, if you are looking for berry shades.  My sis has that one and I have borrowed a few times, it is probably my second choice. If you wanted a little more color the rhubarb is really pretty too.]]></description>
