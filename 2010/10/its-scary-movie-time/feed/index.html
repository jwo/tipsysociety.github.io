		<description><![CDATA[@Chelsea I think I knew the chainsaw part was fictionalized but the whole thing just scares the crap out of me :)
@Sarah I think I blocked Red Dragon--will not watch that again.
@Danielle agreed on slasher I&#039;m not a huge fan either...there&#039;s only a select few slasher movies I&#039;ll watch...for the most part I&#039;m turned off by that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just saw TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE this weekend, and it scared the crap out of me! Luckily, it&#039;s only partially based on a true story. The main villain is based on the same serial killer that PSYCHO and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS are loosely based on, I think his name is Ed Gein? The chainsaw part though, is fictionalized, as are the main victims who are said in the beginning intro to be true. 

(My fiance&#039;s a big, big horror nerd, so he explained it all to me.)]]></description>
