		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, it does feel like a short time to enjoy and transition.  That&#039;s why maybe something small and functional (or just small and decorative) is my speed.  I like #1, too!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Christen we don&#039;t generally host either...though we did the last couple of years so that we would be in control of eating/naptime for the kiddo.  But even then I had no decor--had to borrow from my mom.  Our neighborhood is encouraged to put up Christmas lights Thanksgiving weekend, so it seems like such a short time to have to decorate for Thanksgiving.  All that said, I do love #1 above.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I always WANT to decorate for Thanksgiving (I love it!) but since I never host it, it feels silly, I guess?  I put up the fall wreath I made just before Halloween, and it stays up until we decorate for Christmas.  Maybe if I&#039;m really ambitious I&#039;ll have some fall/harvest-y stuff on the table.  Aaannddd...that&#039;s it.  But now I&#039;m re-thinking.  I mean, at the very least I can pick up dishtowels to hang on the oven door, right?]]></description>
