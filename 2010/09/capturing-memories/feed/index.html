		<description><![CDATA[@Robin we have a Sony HDR-SR12 which the newer model of this would be a Sony HDR-XR150 and it takes PHENOMENAL still photos.  I have heard the same about video cameras not taking great stills but we were so pleasantly surprised ours did, we use it for both pics and videos equally.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We LOVE our flip camera. It&#039;s just so EASY. We wanted something simple to take video of the kid, mainly so we could share with family and friends who live far away. The flip totally fits the bill. And it&#039;s so small, I just toss it in my purse.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have the Sony Handycam HDR-CX150.  It has both a hard drive and flash drive.  The best of both worlds!  I really love it.  It takes outstanding videos.  

Re: AK&#039;s comment.  The Handycam does take still photos, too, but I&#039;ve never tried it.  From what I understand, video cameras typically don&#039;t take very good still photos.  But I don&#039;t have a problem carrying both a camera and the video camera.]]></description>
