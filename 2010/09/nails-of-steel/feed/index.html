		<description><![CDATA[@Court that&#039;s the color I definitely want to try on fingers and toes!!
@Katie ohhh I need to look that one up and see what it looks like!
@Christen I seriously love the hell out of Bubble Bath for my fingernails.  Its a really subtle neutral pinkish color.  My absolute fav with my pasty complexion.  You might get them to do one nail of it to see what it looks like on you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I did a French pedi once when I was a bridesmaid, actually, and it looked OK.  Not the most exciting, but fine.  And my goal for the next 8 days is to keep my mom happy, and if a French pedi does it, great.  What should I do for my hands?  I think my brainpower is shot at this point.  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I never get manis (nail biter, but I have reformed - all for the wedding!) but am a pedi freak.  My favorite is OPI&#039;s Don&#039;t Socratease Me (currently on my toes, a fun irridescent pink-orange) but I also love I&#039;m Not Really a Waitress (fabulous red, my winter go-to).  This is the 2nd place I&#039;ve read that gray is the new &quot;it&quot; color but I&#039;m not sure how it would look against my pasty skin?  I&#039;m getting a mani-pedi next week before the wedding and need a color for my hands...maybe this is it?  Or will I regret doing something trendy?  My mom has already advised me to do something &quot;classic and simple&quot; like a French pedi since my toes will be visible.  Help, Tipsy Gals and Readers!]]></description>
