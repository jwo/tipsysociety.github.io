		<description><![CDATA[I was looking through the links sending out to us and found this one. So glad I did! I co-manage TrendyChic and want to thank you for linking to us!

We are one of Petit Bateau&#039;s largest customers as we carry a good variety from the brand, including the great women&#039;s tees. Because we are in mid-year, we are very, very low on stock. But we will be receiving the Fall in July/August!

@Court @Christen We are priced lower than Petit Bateau. We also send out great e-mail promotions! Sometimes up to 30% off (including sale items!). We also have a coupon for those who subscribe to the mailing list.

@brandi Petit Bateau has a v-neck in their line you may want to check out... http://www.trendychic.com/Petit_Bateau_White_Short_Sleeve_V_Neck_Tee_p/63217-01.htm

Have a good weekend girls!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am desperately seeking the perfect white v-neck. I am willing to pay more than I would for your basic target shirt to find one that is long enough but not too long, and NOT SEE THROUGH OMG. My bra is the same color as my skin, why can I see it though my shirt? I will be watching this post for ideas!]]></description>

I need to be able to easily locate good stuff!  And not cheap, either.  But I have a couple and the color holds beautifully and I swear they never shrink.]]></description>
