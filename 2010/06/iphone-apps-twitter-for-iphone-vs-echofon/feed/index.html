		<description><![CDATA[@Laurin You have to setup what&#039;s called Global Push in your account settings, then you&#039;ll get @&#039;s being pushed... But: they&#039;ll be a 15 minute delay unless the sender is using echofon too.

The Sleep option on Echofon (don&#039;t push me from 10pm to 9am) is pretty cool, I wish you could do that with twitter text notifications.

Being able to use Flickr for image uploads on tweets is teh coolness though, that may be what keeps me on echofon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love Echofon. I&#039;m using the free version and wondering what the $5 version offers that is essential. I think the push text notification for @s might make it worth it for me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I use Echofon and like it...but was actually thinking of switching to the Twitter app...so I am interested in reading the comments that people post. So thank you for asking this!!!

I like that I get push notifications for DMs, but Ii don&#039;t get them for @mentions. Maybe it is a setting? I need to look. It would be nice to get the notifications both.]]></description>
