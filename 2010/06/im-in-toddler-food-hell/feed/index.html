		<description><![CDATA[@Meg yes we used to do string cheese a lot but he&#039;s decided he doesn&#039;t like cheese of any sort right now..not even chips and queso...not sure he&#039;s my child.  We do chicken nuggets for dinner here and there too..so I need to check into your veggie burgers.  I hadn&#039;t even thought about sugar snap peas...that&#039;s a great idea!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cheese cubes and string cheese are a regular part of my kid&#039;s lunch, but that&#039;s out for you.  My 2.5 year old is more of a grazer.  She rarely eats a meal sized portion of anything.  I usually serve her 4 or so small portions at each meal.  

Morningstar Farms veggie chicken nuggets and veggie burgers.
Hummus with crackers and veggie sticks.
Quesadillas - Chicken, black beans and cheese (or just cheese).  These are great for hiding veggies and an easy to-go lunch that can be served room temp.
Wraps - Sometimes I&#039;ll spread a little hummus on a tortilla and roll it up with some chicken or turkey.
Apple slices with peanut butter for dipping.
Sugar snap peas.
And our old standby when she doesn&#039;t want anything else: PB&#038;J!  Natural peanut butter and strawberry preserves on whole grain bread.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Lori we&#039;ve done the rotisserie chicken from time to time... we do it more at dinner time than anything.  And he&#039;s not a huge fan of cookies--go figure! He&#039;d rather have fruit.  Unless another kid is around and THEY are eating cookies.

@Melinda I&#039;ll definitely check out Pirate&#039;s Booty!!

@Danielle mini pasta! I need to check that out...he does seem to like parmesan cheese so I definitely could try that out...  As far as the american cheese--yeah thats a no go--we&#039;ve tried a ton of different cheeses and he&#039;s just not a fan these days.  It wasn&#039;t always the case...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cereal bars (nutra grain, gerber). Freeze dried fruit (it&#039;s kind of crispy. I can find some Disney brand at my market, or the &#039;just fruit&#039; brand at ny health food store). Bertoli makes a mini pasta that only takes 7 min to boil. Big hit around here (as long as I keep it plain...no butter or oil. Go figure!) Tortillas. On the cheese, try taking American slices and cutting them into shapes using cookie cutters. Might peak his interest?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I second the Pirate&#039;s Booty, and any other chips made from vegetables.  For my picky son I get those baby foods in pouches (like Ella&#039;s Kitchen, Revolution Foods, and Plum Organics). He thinks they are a yummy smoothie he can suck right out of the pouch, but I know they are made from fruits and veggies.  I am all for sneaking a little nutrition into the snacks where it comes to my picky eater.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Horizon Little Blends Yogurt (has a hidden veggie and fruit in each serving).  Pirates Booty, White Cheddar (healthier cheese puffs).  Dole Pineapple bowls (in 100% juice). Vanilla Wafers and Animal Crackers.  I like to buy a rotiserrie chicken each week and the girls eat that a lot for lunch.]]></description>
