		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s definitely a worthwhile purchase!  A lot of my mom-friends say ditch the cute jammies and stick with the fugly hospital-issued ones that open in the back (and, will, uh, get stuff on them) and just go for the cute cover-up for pics/visitors. Also, bring some slippers with good traction so your feet don&#039;t have to touch the floor!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Go dark in color.  I suggest navy or black.  You can figure out why.  But it&#039;s going to be GREAT!  And Worth It!  But definitely get a robe.  I went with a black one from Target and I love it, still.  Also, don&#039;t get something too hot because you will be sweating like mo-fo after that baby comes out.  Something about the hormones.  Yay!  So excited for you!]]></description>
