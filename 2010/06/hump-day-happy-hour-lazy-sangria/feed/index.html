		<description><![CDATA[Um, that sounds fantastic!!!!  This is a spiffy drink I can totally handle.  Even when I follow cocktail recipes they still mostly come out tasting of paint thinner.  I&#039;m going to give this a shot next week and see how I do.  Thanks for sharing!  (btw, was just in Texas last weekend and took a picture out front of the HEB - for some reason, a trip to Texas is not complete without a stop there.  Wish I would have known about the samples...:)
