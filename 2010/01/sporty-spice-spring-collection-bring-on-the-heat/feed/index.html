		<description><![CDATA[Found your site via whoorl and I LOVE it! Love the tank and the bag.  I say go for the pink....And I adore OPI nailpolish.  As a naive undergrad student I had a professor leading a class discussion about what our dream jobs would be.  I seriously thought she meant like DREAM JOB....not something serious related to my major or anything (because why would I think that in a college course, right?) Anyway, I said my dream job would be the gal who gets to come up with all the names of OPI nail polish.  The crickets were chirping, I&#039;m telling you.  The professor looked at me as if I had said I wanted to be a stripper.  It was so embarrassing. But it&#039;s still true! Wouldn&#039;t that be the BEST job?]]></description>
