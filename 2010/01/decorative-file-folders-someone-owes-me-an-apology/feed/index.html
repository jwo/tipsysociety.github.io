		<description><![CDATA[LOVE THIS! It is my mission in life to have beautiful things even for the practical stuff.  I always pick them up on clearance at Ofc Depot, Container Store, Anthropologie. I just picked up some cute ones from Anne Taintor. Fun reminders of why I am working and how awesome I am! :)]]></description>
