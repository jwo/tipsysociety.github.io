		<description><![CDATA[@Tina I&#039;m a tshirt girl too and I am still on the search for that perfect white tee. I do love the Forever21 stretch crew neck tees. They are long and have stretch so they keep their shape, BUT they aren&#039;t the thickest tees around. So, alas... I keep searching!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Love this post.  A t-shirt is pretty much my daily wardrobe and I love dressing them up.  I have a hard time finding a good tee though.  Any suggestions.  I like the fit and the length of Old Navy and Gap, but they are too sheer.  (You can see my wobbly shrunken balloon post baby belly). When I find ones that are not sheer, that are not stretchy and soft enough.  Is there the perfect one out there?]]></description>
