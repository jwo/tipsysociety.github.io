		<description><![CDATA[<p>I am determined to complete, by the end of this month, stockings for everyone in the family so that when Christmas decorations come out, everyone in the family has a stocking.  I&#8217;m not a master on the sewing machine but I can do some basics.  So my plan is to do the stocking itself out of felt.  I am going to do names out of material and iron them on via this <a href="http://www.sirbubbadoo.com/2011/08/tutorial-birthday-banner-birthday.html">tutorial</a> on Sir Bubbadoo.   And then I saw in my Sundance catalog, this stocking that has a pocket for your letter to Santa! So I think it&#8217;s all coming together in my mind.  I&#8217;ll post an update of the completed stockings if they don&#8217;t look like total ass.</p>
<p>In other news, did you know that you can get a <a href="http://santasentmealetter.com/category">personalized </a>letter back from Santa after you send yours off? Thanks to <a href="http://www.elleinadspir.com/">Danielle</a>, now I do!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve always been huge Mo Willems fans around here with our first love being the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/078681988X/?tag=weea-20">Pigeon</a> series.  And the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0786818700/?tag=weea-20">Knuffle Bunny</a> has become the newest favorite series around here for bedtime stories. This series follows Trixie and her stuffed bunny and has the same type of humor that Mo Willems is famous for.</p>
<p>By the way, these would be a great gift for a little one.  I love when we get books as gifts!!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>For those of you who missed it, my beautiful sister <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2011/02/der-you-say-its-your-birthday/">Der</a> recently had a birthday.  I wanted to get her something very meaningful for her gift this year instead of just another cute clothing item, although we all know how she loves those :). During my quest I came across the <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/Crazy4Handstamping?ref=pr_shop_more">Crazy4Handstamping</a> etsy shop. They have soooo many cute items you can personalize, and all of them are very reasonably priced. I went with #1, and it was a huge hit, perfect gift for a new mom!

		<description><![CDATA[<p>In the very near future I will be taking a trip across Europe as one last hurrah before I end my career as a professional student and get a real job.  I have been on the hunt for a cute, stylish way to carry my travel documents, most importantly my passport, on all my adventures.  These are just a few of the incredibly cute options I have come across&#8230;</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/62565369/fabric-travel-clutch-build-your-own-pick">Fabric Travel Clutch</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/69125924/travel-passport-wallet-in-blue-airplane">Travel Passport Wallet</a> This is the one I ended up going with. LOVE IT!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/67053399/dollbirdies-passport-wallet-covers">Passport Wallet Cover</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/68727013/passport-cover-amy-butler-purple-and">Passport Cover</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/68623927/passport-cover-i-love-my-cat">Passport Cover</a> I had to throw this one in for a certain <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/court/">crazy cat lady</a> that I know&#8230;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/62198254/passport-cover-hot-pink-black-damask-on">Passport Cover</a></li>
</ol>
<p>P.S. One of these would make a great graduation gift for high school or college grads if anyone needs an idea 🙂</p>
