		<description><![CDATA[<p>We all have them, you know, that one song that you absolutely HAVE to listen to when you&#8217;re on a road trip.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s our road trip songs, what are yours?</p>
<ol>
<li>AK, Pat Green &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000V66OM6/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Carry On</a>&#8220;: Oldie but goodie&#8230;my favorite line is &#8220;Billboards and Bullshit got her down&#8221;.Â  It&#8217;s one of those roll the windows down and blare it kinda songs.Â  Hopefully it&#8217;s sunny out.</li>
<li>Sarah, O.A.R &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00260US9A/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">That Was a Crazy Game of Poker</a>&#8220;: I CAN NOT get enough of this song and it&#8217;s perfect for road trips because it&#8217;s almost 9 minutes long! So basically, by the time you listen to it a few times (you know, to figure out all the words), you&#8217;re probably at least half way to your destination.</li>
<li>Melis, Hank Williams Jr. &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001D5IMC4/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Bartender Song</a>&#8220;: During one of my many years spent in college, a group of friends and I decided to take a road trip to Colorado. For some reason we listened to this song almost once an hour on that 20 hour drive, don&#8217;t ask me why. But now when I think road trip this song always comes to mind&#8230;</li>
<li>Court, Explosions in the Sky &#8220;<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/your-hand-in-mine/id318951781?i=318951791" target="_blank">Your Hand in Mine</a>&#8220;: This is actually not a roll your windows down sing along.Â  Its all instrumental and has lots of highs and lows.Â  Pretty EMO song, but I love it.Â  Ben introduced me to this band and it&#8217;s since been one of my favs.Â  I think I love listening to this song because its 9 damn minutes long and its great to listen to while reading or riding along.</li>

<li>Court, Explosions in the Sky &#8220;<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/your-hand-in-mine/id318951781?i=318951791" target="_blank">Your Hand in Mine</a>&#8220;: This is actually not a roll your windows down sing along.Â  Its all instrumental and has lots of highs and lows.Â  Pretty EMO song, but I love it.Â  Ben introduced me to this band and it&#8217;s since been one of my favs.Â  I think I love listening to this song because its 9 damn minutes long and its great to listen to while reading or riding along.</li>
</ol>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all have them, you know, that one song that you absolutely HAVE to listen to when you&#8217;re on a road trip.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s our road trip songs, what are yours?</p>
<ol>
<li>AK, Pat Green &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000V66OM6/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Carry On</a>&#8220;: Oldie but goodie&#8230;my favorite line is &#8220;Billboards and Bullshit got her down&#8221;.Â  It&#8217;s one of those roll the windows down and blare it kinda songs.Â  Hopefully it&#8217;s sunny out.</li>
<li>Sarah, O.A.R &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00260US9A/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">That Was a Crazy Game of Poker</a>&#8220;: I CAN NOT get enough of this song and it&#8217;s perfect for road trips because it&#8217;s almost 9 minutes long! So basically, by the time you listen to it a few times (you know, to figure out all the words), you&#8217;re probably at least half way to your destination.</li>
<li>Melis, Hank Williams Jr. &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001D5IMC4/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Bartender Song</a>&#8220;: During one of my many years spent in college, a group of friends and I decided to take a road trip to Colorado. For some reason we listened to this song almost once an hour on that 20 hour drive, don&#8217;t ask me why. But now when I think road trip this song always comes to mind&#8230;</li>
<li>Court, Explosions in the Sky &#8220;<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/your-hand-in-mine/id318951781?i=318951791" target="_blank">Your Hand in Mine</a>&#8220;: This is actually not a roll your windows down sing along.Â  Its all instrumental and has lots of highs and lows.Â  Pretty EMO song, but I love it.Â  Ben introduced me to this band and it&#8217;s since been one of my favs.Â  I think I love listening to this song because its 9 damn minutes long and its great to listen to while reading or riding along.</li>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Tipsy Favs this week is highlighting our go-to music&#8230;the album we can always fall back on as an all time fav when we don&#8217;t really have anything else to listen to or the album we listen to with some sort of obsessive compulsive disorder or ALL OF THE ABOVE!</p>
<ol>
<li>Melis-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002NJ8X9G/?tag=weea-20">Glee Soundtrack</a>-I am a self proclaimed GLEEK and you can find me singing along loudly and off key any time I&#8217;m in my vehicle to one of the many Glee soundtracks that I am the proud owner of. IÂ have perfected Defying Gravity, except for that last high note.. gets me every time.</li>
<li>Sarah-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000CE752/?tag=weea-20">George Strait</a>-George Strait is THE MAN&#8230;that&#8217;s all there is to say. His sound hasn&#8217;t changed much (if at all) in the 25+ years I&#8217;ve been listening to him and I love him for that&#8230;this is one of those things that if I had to choose 1 artist, he would be it, and this CD is a good overview of all his greatest hits!</li>
<li>Court-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000AADYRQ/?tag=weea-20">Deathcab for Cutie</a>-I&#8217;m a total emo when it comes to music. This band defines alternative for me. This band also holds a special place in my heart because Ben and I happen to both adore them. Anywhere anytime I&#8217;ll belt out these well written meaningful lyrics.</li>
<li>AK-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006J3UT/?tag=weea-20">Faith Hill</a>-I&#8217;m a huge Faith Hill fan. I have all her albums, I&#8217;ve seen her in concert, etc. Â This album specifically got a lot of flack for not being country enough or whatever but I have to say it really came along at a turning point in my life and I listened to &#8220;Stronger&#8221; probably more times than any other song ever.</li>
