<div class="post-info"><span class="date published time" title="2012-01-04T06:00:43+00:00">January 4, 2012</span>  by <span class="author vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="../../../../author/court/index.html" rel="author">court</a></span></span>  </div><div class="entry-content"><p>This where I insert my excuse for going MIA for a number of months 🙂  Life happens, right?  But this is a great post that&#8217;s always fun to do and lets me verbal vomit about my life in the last year.  So here goes it&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>1. What did you do in 2011 that you’d never done before?</strong></p>
<p>Entered and completed a 10k and lived to write about it.  HAHAA.</p>
<p><strong>2. Did you keep your new year’s resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</strong></p>
<p>I would say that I didn&#8217;t technically meet my resolution of losing the amount of weight that I wanted, but I am pumped for the new year.</p>
<p><strong>3. Did anyone close to you give birth? </strong></p>
<p>OMG did they ever.  Sarah and AK both in one year.  It&#8217;s been a lot of baby talk round these parts.</p>
<p><strong>4. Did anyone close to you die?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I had a cousin pass in July.  Very sad situation that really rattled my family.  Unfortunately my Aunt also died just last month while in the hospital under going heart surgery.  You just have to buckle down as a family and push through the good and the bad.  There was more bad this year than I would have liked.</p>
<p><strong>5. What countries did you visit?</strong></p>
<p>JAMAICA BABY.  Ben&#8217;s sis got married in Montego Bay and we were able to have a really badass vacation there in turn.  Snorkling was my favorite activity there.</p>
<p><strong>6. What would you like to have in 2012 that you didn’t have in 2011?</strong></p>
<p>A siamese cat that magically gets over his little man, I hate every other cat in the house so I am going to piss in a pile of clothes act.</p>
<p><strong>7. What dates from 2011 will be etched upon your memory, and why?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately my cousins death on July 27, 2011.  We were very close for a number of years and again, just took the whole thing pretty hard.  It was a very senseless situation.</p>
<p>I hate that the one thing that sticks out in my mind is a really bad event, but its what I think of first.</p>
<p><strong>8. What was your biggest achievement of this year?</strong></p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t entirely complete because the school is not over, but&#8230;.volunteering to be and acting as homeroom mom.  With that comes organization of all class parties and field day.  It&#8217;s also given me more time with Austin at a time when he is really starting to naturally become more independent.   So far is been a lot of fun and I&#8217;ve been able to be front row for all of Austin&#8217;s activities at school.</p>
<p><strong>9. What was your biggest failure?</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have anything that I look back and said that I completely failed on.  There are times I have acted in ways that I shouldn&#8217;t have though.</p>
<p><strong>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</strong></p>
<p>If sick is being defined as an illness or injury that actually had you down,  I do not believe I was sick one single time in 2011.  Tipsy ladies, feel free to correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p><strong>11. What was the best thing you bought?</strong></p>
<p>A new TV for our bedroom.  I had thought before that I really didn&#8217;t care about TVs, until I got a nice upgraded one to watch my Law and Orders on.</p>
<p><strong>12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</strong></p>
<p>Ben was great with all the deaths and goings on this year.  You know simple things like just sitting with someone at the hospital or in a funeral service make the world of difference.  You know that you have someone there that is giving you 100% of their support.</p>
<p>Another person that has totally blown me away is my dear friend Der.  Its been pretty amazing watching her take a natural gift and be able to turn into a career that makes everyone of her customers so happy.  Shes truly got something good going there.</p>
<p><strong>13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?</strong></p>
<p>Blah.</p>
<p><strong>14. Where did most your money go? </strong></p>
<p>Its honestly felt like Austin ate, literally ate in food, my paycheck.  What little was left went to Austin&#8217;s first football season.  What a great experience and GREAT people watching.  Soccer was nothing compared to these characters.</p>
<p><strong>15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?</strong></p>
<p>I did/am totally wrapped up in the excitement of watching my best friends with their babies.  Its been a lot of fun to see all tha&#8217; boys and its also fun that we are all boy moms now, some of us for the second time.  Its a very special club.</p>
<p><strong>16. What song will always remind you of 2011?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;What Sarah Said&#8221; by Death Cab for Cutie</p>
<p><strong>17.</strong> <strong>Compared to this time last year, are you: a) happier or sadder? b) thinner or fatter? c) richer or poorer?</strong></p>
<p>Happier still.  It&#8217;s still been a fun year and I have the best people in my life.</p>
<p>Actually if you get down to technicalities, I am thinner&#8211;but not by much!</p>
<p>Same.</p>
<p><strong>18. What do you wish you’d done more of?</strong></p>
<p>Traveling.  Its so nice to get out and see new places and experience new things.  I want to do more of that in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>19. What do you wish you’d done less of?</strong></p>
<p>Worrying about things I can&#8217;t change.</p>
<p><strong>20. How did you spend Christmas?</strong></p>
<p>In Houston with my family and Ben&#8217;s family.  Christmas Eve is at my parents place with all of my Mom&#8217;s side of the family.  Its a fun and extremely loud and obnoxious gathering.  One of my Aunts threatened to &#8220;slap the shit&#8221; out of another one of my Aunts this year, so that&#8217;s always a good laugh.</p>
<p><strong>21. Did you fall in love with 2011?</strong></p>
<p>I think in any relationship you continue to get closer and closer when its going good.  So I would definitely say with Ben.  CHEESE BALL!</p>
<p><strong>22. What was your favorite TV program?</strong></p>
<p>DUDE&#8230;.I seriously have an issue.  All I watch is Law and Order on DVDs.  Now that I have been through all of the Law and Order: SVUs,  I have moved on to the orignal Law and Orders.  I am seriously an addict.</p>
<p><strong>23. Do you hate anyone now that you didn’t hate this time last year?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>24. What was the best book you read?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely fell head over heels for the Hunger Games Trilogy.</p>
<p><strong>25. What was your greatest musical discovery?</strong></p>
<p>Sarah Jaffe. Actually Ben discovered her for me and took me to a concert.  She&#8217;s amazing and a REALLY chill.</p>
<p><strong>26. What did you want and get?</strong></p>
<p>You know I decided to look for a job in January of 2011 and in less than a month I landed a job that I absolutely love.  I think that was my best catch this year.</p>
<p><strong>27. What did you want and not get?</strong></p>
<p>Nothing I can even think of.</p>
<p><strong>28. What was your favorite film of 2010?</strong></p>
<p>I am going to go with&#8230;.Limitless.  It had me tuned in from the second it started.</p>
<p><strong>29. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</strong></p>
<p>On my 31st birthday Ben took me to a concert and then surprised me with a bunch of my friends that were already at a bar waiting for me to ring in the big 3-1.  I really felt like it was &#8220;my day&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>30. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</strong></p>
<p>I think a TAD more organization would have helped.  I don&#8217; think I am in immense need, but I started off the new year by organizaing all of my jewelry.  My next battle is my closet.  So I have high hopes to get more organized. 🙂</p>
<p><strong>31. How would you describe your personal fashion concept of 2010?</strong></p>
<p>Patterns and bangles.  I did a lot of thrift shopping this year as well.</p>
<p><strong>32. What kept you sane?</strong></p>
<p>The good and bad and up and downs of raising and being as involved as I can with Austin.  Its been work for Ben and I together as well.  Its definitely a learning process that never stops.</p>
<p><strong>33. What political issue stirred you the most?</strong></p>
<p>When that TV reporter had some type of seizure or something and was talking all crazy.  That stirred me real good.  Google it.  Thank me later.</p>
<p><strong>34. Who did you miss?</strong></p>
<p>I miss working my old co-workers, they were a really fun crew.  They have all also moved on to other jobs since then as well.  Its just so important to have people that make you laugh, you can talk to and rely on at work.  I spend more time at work than anywhere else, so that kind of thing is important to me.</p>
<p><strong>35. Who was the best new person you met?</strong></p>
<p>On Austin&#8217;s football team there are twin boys (age 10) that we have gotten to know during this year.  I have to say they are so damn cool and have a way of making you look at things in a totally different perspective.  They have two of the sweetest personalities and couldn&#8217;t have a better outlook on things, considering that haven&#8217;t had the best home life.</p>
<p><strong>36. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2011.</strong></p>
<p>That you really should try to make the best of each relationship, day, conversation.</p>
<p><strong>37. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year.</strong></p>
<p><em>Love is watching someone die.— Death Cab for Cutie</em></p>

<p><strong>37. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year.</strong></p>
<p><em>“Life&#8217;s not the breath you take, the breathing in and out, that gets you through the day, ain&#8217;t what it&#8217;s all about. You just might miss the point, trying to win the race. Life&#8217;s not the breaths you take, but the moments that take your breath away&#8230;” — George Strait</em></p>

I try to keep up&#8230;but we had a whole month where everybody was sick around here and that&#8217;s probably what started it all.  So generally when I get behind in Google Reader, I will star things to read later or pin later. Then I&#8217;ll get to a certain point where I&#8217;m catching up and can go back and read everything that I&#8217;ve starred or pin it to one of my pinterest boards.  I thought I&#8217;d share some of the stuff that stuck with me lately&#8230;.a round up of sorts kinda like what Danielle over at <a href="http://www.elleinadspir.com/">elleinad spir </a>does on Fridays. Except some of these things date back to maybe September. I know, I know!</p>

He knows what country the racers are from, what their numbers are, where the 3 races in the World Grand Prix take place, etc etc. So, we play with cars every. single. day.  Keeping that in mind I&#8217;ve been trying to come up something for his birthday.  I&#8217;ve got 3 different things in mind that are potential winners.</p>

It all started with my with my almost 3 year old and it picked up speed with my 4 month old.  I&#8217;ve got to say that my absolute favorite PJs are from Hanna Andersson so you can obviously see why I&#8217;d be a fan of Serena &amp; Lily&#8217;s newest PJs where they partnered with Hanna Andersson&#8230;.totally adorable.  I&#8217;m also a long time fan of Hatley footed PJs too.  Hatley has a bunch of these footie ones on sale.  The best thing about all of these is that they zip up.  No fumbling with snaps late at night!</p>

<div class="post-info"><span class="date published time" title="2011-08-25T06:00:58+00:00">August 25, 2011</span>  by <span class="author vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="../../../../author/ak/index.html" rel="author">ak</a></span></span>  </div><div class="entry-content"><p>I just read Jennie&#8217;s <a href="http://www.shelikespurple.com/shelikespurple/2011/08/my-typical-day.html">post</a> over at She Likes Purple regarding her typical day and loved it and thought I&#8217;d play along as well!</p>
<p><strong>6:00a</strong> Hank (our almost 4 month old) starts stirring, I get up and go get him and bring him in bed with my husband and I and sometimes he&#8217;ll fall back asleep until my almost 3 year old, Jack, starts waking up.</p>
<p><strong>6:45-7a</strong> Jack is for sure awake by this point. We all file downstairs. My husband, Jesse, gives Hank a bottle while I fix Jack his breakfast and fix my husband and I some form of caffeinated beverage.</p>
<p><strong>7:30a</strong> Jack starts playing with his cars and Jesse and I fix our breakfasts while Hank swings or bounces in some sort of contraption.</p>
<p><strong>7:45a</strong> Hank is thoroughly over said contraption and hopefully one of us has snarfed their cereal down fast enough to go change up his scenery.</p>
<p><strong>8:00a</strong> Jesse, who works from home, generally tells us &#8220;goodbye&#8221; and heads back upstairs to start his work day. We resume car playing.</p>
<p><strong>9:00a</strong> We load the cars up and head upstairs where Jack plays while I get Hank down for a nap.  This generally involves Jack running back and forth between Hank&#8217;s room and the game room in a LOUD whisper asking me what I&#8217;m doing, what&#8217;s Baby Hank doing, which Cars 2 racer is from Spain, Japan, England, Italy, etc etc.</p>
<p><strong>9:20a-ish</strong> Jack and I head back downstairs for his second breakfast of yogurt and blueberries.</p>
<p><strong>9:40-9:45a</strong> Hank wakes up. Sometimes he&#8217;s happy, sometimes not.</p>
<p><strong>10:00a-10:15a</strong> Bottle for Hank. Jack is asking me about (Cars 2) Finn McMissile and Holley Shiftwell and Grem and Acer and Professor Z and what they are doing and where they are going and do they have engines and do they need car washes.</p>
<p><strong>10:16a </strong>Change Hank&#8217;s poopy diaper</p>
<p><strong>10:20-11:00a</strong> At this point we generally get &#8220;the big phone&#8221; (the iPad) out and either do some puzzles, read stories or practice writing letters with some of the apps.  Hank is either happily screeching in my lap or swinging or in the jumperoo.</p>
<p><strong>11:00a</strong> Jesse comes downstairs. I fix Jack&#8217;s lunch and Jesse fixes our lunch.</p>
<p><strong>11:30a</strong> Just as Jesse is putting our lunches down on the table, Hank is ready for a nap.  I head back upstairs to get Hank down. Jack finishes up lunch with Jesse downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>12:00p</strong> Jesse usually takes Jack up and reads a couple of stories and gets him down for his nap. And I try and get my lunch in at this point.  This is also the point in time where I attempt to do some sort of laundry or pay bills or read email or if I&#8217;m lucky get through some blogs on Google Reader.</p>
<p><strong>1:00-1:30p</strong> Jesse heads to the gym. Hank wakes up sometime around now.  Bottle time!</p>
<p><strong>1:31p</strong> Change Hank&#8217;s poopy diaper.</p>
<p><strong>1:45-2:00p</strong> Jack wakes up.  I run upstairs and get him and we come back downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>2:00p-3:00p </strong>We generally need a snack and a Team Umizoomi or Bubble Guppies or Curious George or SOMETHING. We build car dealerships with legos, or oil derricks, or giant car washes. And I NEED caffeine.</p>
<p><strong>3:00p </strong>Hank is ready for a nap.  We head upstairs and I turn on Mister Rogers where they explain how they make crayons and Jack is fascinated by this process. However, in general we repeat what happens at 9a where Jack is running back and forth between Hank&#8217;s room and the game room and in a LOUD whisper is asking me what I&#8217;m doing, what&#8217;s Baby Hank doing, which Cars 2 racer is from Spain, Japan, England, Italy, etc etc.</p>
<p><strong>3:40-3:45p</strong> Hank wakes up, we head back downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>4:00p</strong> Bottle Time!</p>
<p><strong>4:16p</strong> Change Hank&#8217;s poopy diaper.</p>
<p><strong>4:20-4:30p </strong>I ask Jack if he wants to go get the mail, he says no.  I get the keys and we all head outside to get the mail. Come inside drenched in sweat and heat rash already forming on Jack. I&#8217;m swearing under my breath about how hot it is as we walk back inside.</p>
<p><strong>4:30p-5:00p</strong> Jesse heads downstairs. I try and fit in a trip to the gym.</p>
<p><strong>5:00-5:30p</strong> We all sit down to eat dinner.</p>
<p><strong>5:30p</strong> Hank goes down for a nap.</p>
<p><strong>6:00p</strong> Hank is up!</p>
<p><strong>6:00-7:00p</strong> Dance parties and piggy back rides!</p>
<p><strong>6:45p</strong> Hank is PISSED that he is still downstairs and you people aren&#8217;t taking him up for a bath and a bottle and bedtime.  He voices this loudly. Jesse heads up with Hank and does that routine.</p>
<p><strong>7:00p-8:00p</strong> Jack and I head upstairs.  He takes a bath, then we go and read 2 or 3 or 4 books depending on how persuasive he is.  Then we have some Cars 2 talk.  Then lights out.</p>
<p><strong>8:00p</strong> I shower and then head downstairs to do the dishes.</p>
<p><strong>8:30p </strong>We settle in downstairs and watch whatever we have recorded on TiVo and Jesse works.</p>
<p><strong>10:00p</strong> Head upstairs and give Hank a bottle and watch a Friends rerun.</p>
<p><strong>10:30p-11:30</strong> Pass out from exhaustion.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s my day.  And that&#8217;s just a regular at home day, not a day when we have somewhere to go.  What&#8217;s your typical day?</p>
