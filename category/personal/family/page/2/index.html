<div class="post-info"><span class="date published time" title="2011-08-25T06:00:58+00:00">August 25, 2011</span>  by <span class="author vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="../../../../../author/ak/index.html" rel="author">ak</a></span></span>  </div><div class="entry-content"><p>I just read Jennie&#8217;s <a href="http://www.shelikespurple.com/shelikespurple/2011/08/my-typical-day.html">post</a> over at She Likes Purple regarding her typical day and loved it and thought I&#8217;d play along as well!</p>
<p><strong>6:00a</strong> Hank (our almost 4 month old) starts stirring, I get up and go get him and bring him in bed with my husband and I and sometimes he&#8217;ll fall back asleep until my almost 3 year old, Jack, starts waking up.</p>
<p><strong>6:45-7a</strong> Jack is for sure awake by this point. We all file downstairs. My husband, Jesse, gives Hank a bottle while I fix Jack his breakfast and fix my husband and I some form of caffeinated beverage.</p>
<p><strong>7:30a</strong> Jack starts playing with his cars and Jesse and I fix our breakfasts while Hank swings or bounces in some sort of contraption.</p>
<p><strong>7:45a</strong> Hank is thoroughly over said contraption and hopefully one of us has snarfed their cereal down fast enough to go change up his scenery.</p>
<p><strong>8:00a</strong> Jesse, who works from home, generally tells us &#8220;goodbye&#8221; and heads back upstairs to start his work day. We resume car playing.</p>
<p><strong>9:00a</strong> We load the cars up and head upstairs where Jack plays while I get Hank down for a nap.  This generally involves Jack running back and forth between Hank&#8217;s room and the game room in a LOUD whisper asking me what I&#8217;m doing, what&#8217;s Baby Hank doing, which Cars 2 racer is from Spain, Japan, England, Italy, etc etc.</p>
<p><strong>9:20a-ish</strong> Jack and I head back downstairs for his second breakfast of yogurt and blueberries.</p>
<p><strong>9:40-9:45a</strong> Hank wakes up. Sometimes he&#8217;s happy, sometimes not.</p>
<p><strong>10:00a-10:15a</strong> Bottle for Hank. Jack is asking me about (Cars 2) Finn McMissile and Holley Shiftwell and Grem and Acer and Professor Z and what they are doing and where they are going and do they have engines and do they need car washes.</p>
<p><strong>10:16a </strong>Change Hank&#8217;s poopy diaper</p>
<p><strong>10:20-11:00a</strong> At this point we generally get &#8220;the big phone&#8221; (the iPad) out and either do some puzzles, read stories or practice writing letters with some of the apps.  Hank is either happily screeching in my lap or swinging or in the jumperoo.</p>
<p><strong>11:00a</strong> Jesse comes downstairs. I fix Jack&#8217;s lunch and Jesse fixes our lunch.</p>
<p><strong>11:30a</strong> Just as Jesse is putting our lunches down on the table, Hank is ready for a nap.  I head back upstairs to get Hank down. Jack finishes up lunch with Jesse downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>12:00p</strong> Jesse usually takes Jack up and reads a couple of stories and gets him down for his nap. And I try and get my lunch in at this point.  This is also the point in time where I attempt to do some sort of laundry or pay bills or read email or if I&#8217;m lucky get through some blogs on Google Reader.</p>
<p><strong>1:00-1:30p</strong> Jesse heads to the gym. Hank wakes up sometime around now.  Bottle time!</p>
<p><strong>1:31p</strong> Change Hank&#8217;s poopy diaper.</p>
<p><strong>1:45-2:00p</strong> Jack wakes up.  I run upstairs and get him and we come back downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>2:00p-3:00p </strong>We generally need a snack and a Team Umizoomi or Bubble Guppies or Curious George or SOMETHING. We build car dealerships with legos, or oil derricks, or giant car washes. And I NEED caffeine.</p>
<p><strong>3:00p </strong>Hank is ready for a nap.  We head upstairs and I turn on Mister Rogers where they explain how they make crayons and Jack is fascinated by this process. However, in general we repeat what happens at 9a where Jack is running back and forth between Hank&#8217;s room and the game room and in a LOUD whisper is asking me what I&#8217;m doing, what&#8217;s Baby Hank doing, which Cars 2 racer is from Spain, Japan, England, Italy, etc etc.</p>
<p><strong>3:40-3:45p</strong> Hank wakes up, we head back downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>4:00p</strong> Bottle Time!</p>
<p><strong>4:16p</strong> Change Hank&#8217;s poopy diaper.</p>
<p><strong>4:20-4:30p </strong>I ask Jack if he wants to go get the mail, he says no.  I get the keys and we all head outside to get the mail. Come inside drenched in sweat and heat rash already forming on Jack. I&#8217;m swearing under my breath about how hot it is as we walk back inside.</p>
<p><strong>4:30p-5:00p</strong> Jesse heads downstairs. I try and fit in a trip to the gym.</p>
<p><strong>5:00-5:30p</strong> We all sit down to eat dinner.</p>
<p><strong>5:30p</strong> Hank goes down for a nap.</p>
<p><strong>6:00p</strong> Hank is up!</p>
<p><strong>6:00-7:00p</strong> Dance parties and piggy back rides!</p>
<p><strong>6:45p</strong> Hank is PISSED that he is still downstairs and you people aren&#8217;t taking him up for a bath and a bottle and bedtime.  He voices this loudly. Jesse heads up with Hank and does that routine.</p>
<p><strong>7:00p-8:00p</strong> Jack and I head upstairs.  He takes a bath, then we go and read 2 or 3 or 4 books depending on how persuasive he is.  Then we have some Cars 2 talk.  Then lights out.</p>
<p><strong>8:00p</strong> I shower and then head downstairs to do the dishes.</p>
<p><strong>8:30p </strong>We settle in downstairs and watch whatever we have recorded on TiVo and Jesse works.</p>
<p><strong>10:00p</strong> Head upstairs and give Hank a bottle and watch a Friends rerun.</p>
<p><strong>10:30p-11:30</strong> Pass out from exhaustion.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s my day.  And that&#8217;s just a regular at home day, not a day when we have somewhere to go.  What&#8217;s your typical day?</p>

			<div class="entry-content"><p>I was given some pretty sound advice from our pediatrician to start my little man with a practice sippy cup at 6 months old, so he would be a pro by one year. Well, thanks to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000WMO5KC/?tag=weea-20">3 stage Nuby cup</a> we were bottle free in our household a few months shy of the year mark!</p>
<p>This bottle/cup transition was so smooth I have to tell each and every one of you with bambinos to try this out. It allows for your little one to hold the bottle and learn to drink and when they are ready you can switch to the sippy cup nipple that comes included. I can not say enough great things about these little gems!</p>

AJ&#8217;s feet are big and fat and would not fit in most shoes I tried to shove his poor foot into. When we received these they were perfect to say the least!

They are soft and flexible, yet don&#8217;t make him look like a street urchin when I let him down in public places. Well done, Court!</p>
