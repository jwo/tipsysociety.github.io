We are big time kids books readers over here. Books before nap time, books before bedtime and in between.  We are always on the hunt for good books. Just for reference I have a 4 year old and a not quite 2 year old.  The 2 year old LOVES LOVES the Pete the Cat books with a passion.  Literally he sees those books and squeals in delight.</p>

<p>Yes, I am going to talk about that recent (or maybe it was last year, but who knows because I&#8217;m always behind the literary times) book phenom: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0345803485/?tag=weea-20+shades+of+gray" target="_blank"><em>50 Shades of Grey</em></a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve obviously been hearing about this trilogy for some time now, but never really considered reading it until I saw Barbara Walters interview of her most fascinating people of the year. When Ms. Walters admitted that SHE read the books, I thought, OK, I can totally handle this. So, over the Christmas holidays when my hubby, toddler, and I were <del>bored to tears with no television and in the middle of nowhere</del> visiting my MIL, I thought it would be a good time to start reading said books&#8230;</p>
<p>HOLY SHIT BALLS (technical term), I could literally not put the book down! Within a week I had read the first 2 books read and had started on the 3rd. Whew, I am now completely finished and telling everyone I can think of to read these books. Don&#8217;t be afraid of the whole BDSM thing, that&#8217;s not the main part of the story&#8230;.READ IT!</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll thank me, E.L James, and start begging Hollywood to make the movie already! 🙂</p>

<p>Yes, I am going to talk about that recent (or maybe it was last year, but who knows because I&#8217;m always behind the literary times) book phenom: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0345803485/?tag=weea-20+shades+of+gray" target="_blank"><em>50 Shades of Grey</em></a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve obviously been hearing about this trilogy for some time now, but never really considered reading it until I saw Barbara Walters interview of her most fascinating people of the year. When Ms. Walters admitted that SHE read the books, I thought, OK, I can totally handle this. So, over the Christmas holidays when my hubby, toddler, and I were <del>bored to tears with no television and in the middle of nowhere</del> visiting my MIL, I thought it would be a good time to start reading said books&#8230;</p>
<p>HOLY SHIT BALLS (technical term), I could literally not put the book down! Within a week I had read the first 2 books read and had started on the 3rd. Whew, I am now completely finished and telling everyone I can think of to read these books. Don&#8217;t be afraid of the whole BDSM thing, that&#8217;s not the main part of the story&#8230;.READ IT!</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll thank me, E.L James, and start begging Hollywood to make the movie already! 🙂</p>

I got two of these journals last week or so and I&#8217;m LOVING them.  Basically it prompts you with a question to ask your child and you write down their response. It provides one question for every day of the year and has a spot for the next three years to record answers. We leave it on our kitchen table and ask our 4 year old the day&#8217;s question at breakfast or dinner or whenever we remember.  So far it&#8217;s been very fun!! Let me give you an example of one of the responses I got yesterday:</p>
<p>Question/Prompt: I felt awful when_____<br />
Answer: It was Sunday and I broke up with Taylor Swift.</p>
<p>(Don&#8217;t worry, they have since gotten back to together and have plans to marry)</p>

<li> Baby&#8217;s breath in galvanized tubs (large or small): from <a href="http://global.theknot.com/join/MemberLogin.aspx?target=http%3a%2f%2fweddings.theknot.com%2fReal-Weddings%2f85011%2fdetailview.aspx%3fSTOPREDIRECTING%3dTRUE%26id%3d85011%26type%3d3%26wedding%2bdetails%3dceremony%2bdecor%26PgReferrer%3d" target="_blank">theknot.com</a>. After all, baby&#8217;s breath is CHEAP!</li>
<li>Flowers in vintage cans: from <a href="http://peacockfeatherevents.blogspot.com/2009/10/wedding-wild-flowers.html" target="_blank">http://peacockfeatherevents.blogspot.com/2009/10/wedding-wild-flowers.html</a>. You could also just take regular cans and cover the cans with either scrapbook or brown paper, which might be easier to find if you don&#8217;t have vintage cans on hand.</li>
<li>Flowers, curly willow, and raffia in clear vases: from <a href="http://jenelisebeth.blogspot.com/2009/07/etsy-martha-stewart-handmade-weddings.html" target="_blank">http://jenelisebeth.blogspot.com/2009/07/etsy-martha-stewart-handmade-weddings.html</a>. We would replace the yellow with something that matches the colors of the party.</li>
<li>Mason jars, twine, and flowers: from <a href="http://wedding.allwomenstalk.com/5-rustic-wedding-centerpiece-ideas/" target="_blank">http://wedding.allwomenstalk.com/5-rustic-wedding-centerpiece-ideas/</a>.</li>

		<title>New Years Resolutions: Sarah 2012</title>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Man oh man&#8230;I cannot BELIEVE it&#8217;s already 2012! I need to get this year started off right, so I&#8217;m actually going to create some very attainable resolutions for myself.</p>
<p>1. WORKOUT!!!! Yes, I have lost all my baby weight (+5 pounds), which means I&#8217;m actually at my ultimate goal weight and I was NOT at that weight pre-preggo. However, I&#8217;m thinking the main reason I&#8217;m at my ultimate goal weight is because I have lost a lot of muscle mass&#8230;? Hahaha&#8230;I&#8217;m not sure this is actually the reason, but my workouts have been few and far between. In July, I started the post-baby weight loss process and hit it hard, including at least 2 sessions of bikram yoga a week mixed in with cardio and weights. I had a great routine that I was really happy with until the end of August, when my hubby took a new job and was out of town Mon.-Fri . I mean, who wants to work out after taking care of a baby ALL day by yourself???? NOT ME!!!! His traveling has calmed down a LOT, so I&#8217;m joining the YMCA and going to get back into fighting shape!</p>
<p>2. BLOG!!!! When us gals started this blog in 2009 it was a fabulous creative outlet, but I obviously put writing on the back burner when baby C came along in March. I work full-time from home and between managing my baby, work, and house-hold chores, I never really got a good grasp to make time for ANY creative outlets. This is ALL changing. I&#8217;m literally forcing myself to get back on track because it&#8217;s a great way to get your thoughts out AND to fake shop&#8230;I mean, lets face it, it&#8217;s hard to justify that uber-cute new spring wardrobe when you have a new little one, but it will never hurt to look! 🙂</p>
<p>Happy 2012 everyone!</p>
