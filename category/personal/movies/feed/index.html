		<description><![CDATA[<p>I was having a conversation with a friend of mine the other day about scary movies.  He said he&#8217;d seen the newest exorcist movie and he didn&#8217;t think it was that scary.  He proceeded to tell me the plot and it sounded pretty damn scary to me! So I asked him, what kind of movie scares him? He explained the kind of movie that scared him and it seem like maybe his ultimate scary movie is like science experiment horror.</p>
<p>So that got me thinking&#8230;what do I think is scary? Â I think a big thing for me is if something is based on a true story then it definitely scares the crap out of me. Â These movies have scared the crap out of me through the years.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/079073804X/?tag=weea-20">The Exorcist</a>-I&#8217;m pretty sure this is based on a true story&#8230;this to me is the ultimate scary movie.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000C8ART/?tag=weea-20">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a>-This too is based on a true story. Â I live in Texas. Â And I still haven&#8217;t been able to make it through the entire movie.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JQTT/?tag=weea-20">A Nightmare on Elm Street</a>-I know this isn&#8217;t based on a true story but Freddie was a child murderer that is coming back to avenge his death. Â And I also am very creeped out by that song in the movie&#8230;One, two Freddie&#8217;s comin for you&#8230;.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00009UW0N/?tag=weea-20">Halloween</a>-This could totally be a true story. Â Dude kills his sister, goes into an insane asylum and then escapes and starts killing people. Â Amirite? Â Side note: did you know the mask that Michael the killer wears in this film was created from William Shatner&#8217;s face?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005JLTK/?tag=weea-20">The Ring</a>-Just the girl crawling out of the tv gets me every time.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000V4UFZK/?tag=weea-20">Poltergeist</a>-I think I&#8217;ve seen this one the most out of all of these. Â The house built on a cemetary&#8230;hearing Carol Anne via the television&#8230;DON&#8217;T GO INTO THE LIGHT! Â And finally the fact that a lot of these people that acted in this movie are now dead is creepy to me&#8230;a Poltergeist curse!</li>
</ol>
<p>So what is your genre of scary movie?</p>

	<p>There are so many things in this world that I would love to have but a) will never buy for myself, and b) could not afford right now even if I did want to buy them. That, my friends, is the beauty of a birthday, and mine is right around the corner. Here are some items that are on my birthday wish list this year&#8230;</p>

For anybody who drinks a cup or 2 of coffee every day but not a whole pot, this is the perfect gift. No more cleaning a coffee pot. Ever again.</li>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>As you know, Court and I are <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/03/confessions-of-tipsy-girls/">Twi-hards</a>.Â  I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily call us fanatics or anything, we are just fans.Â  Der is too, although she hasn&#8217;t read any of the series, her sister has just told her all the details from the book and then she watched the movies.Â  Court and I have tried to get Der to read the books and granted, she started the first one but I don&#8217;t think she ever finished it.Â  Meaning I think she may have gotten to page 5 and then her sister was just basically her Cliff&#8217;s Notes. So I think that makes Der a Twi-Semi Hard (no pun intended).</p>
<p>So anyway, back to the subject at hand.Â  Eclipse.Â  It&#8217;s coming out next week.Â  My husband has so graciously decided to take off work and take me to the 10a showing because it comes out on my birthday.Â  What a present eh?Â  And before you say anything, I&#8217;m going to just go ahead and out my husband because he has also read all of the books and watched the movies and I&#8217;m not sure if he&#8217;s going to kill me for saying that, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to be a hardship for him to watch the movie with me, if you get my drift.</p>
<p>I was seriously tempted to do the whole Twilight she-bang at our theater the night before where they show Twilight, New Moon and then a midnight showing of Eclipse&#8230;but let&#8217;s be honest here&#8230;I&#8217;d still have to get up at 6:30a with the kiddo and I honestly don&#8217;t know if I could stay up that late.Â  Pathetic, I know.Â  So I would like to know who of you are Twi-hards and are you going to see the movie when it comes out?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>So my child wakes up at 6a most days, takes 1 nap that can range anywhere from 15 minutes to 2 hours depending on the day, and the rest of the time? The rest of the time involves running, lots and lots of running and/or thinking the furniture in our house is the <a href="http://littlegym.com/">Little Gym</a>.Â  Generally the only time the kiddo will sit still is if I put on Toy Story 1 or 2.Â  And I&#8217;m gonna go ahead and admit it, it&#8217;s really nice to sit down for a breather.Â  So we are very much looking forward to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0435761/">Toy Story 3</a> coming out and having that be The First Movie Experience.</p>
<p>So with all that said, I have two questions for you:</p>
<p>What is your kiddo&#8217;s favorite movie?</p>
<p>And why does Bullseye (horse) not speak when Hamm (pig), Rex (dinosaur), and Slinky (dog) do?</p>
