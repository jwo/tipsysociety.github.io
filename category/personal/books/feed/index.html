We are big time kids books readers over here. Books before nap time, books before bedtime and in between.  We are always on the hunt for good books. Just for reference I have a 4 year old and a not quite 2 year old.  The 2 year old LOVES LOVES the Pete the Cat books with a passion.  Literally he sees those books and squeals in delight.</p>

<p>Yes, I am going to talk about that recent (or maybe it was last year, but who knows because I&#8217;m always behind the literary times) book phenom: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0345803485/?tag=weea-20+shades+of+gray" target="_blank"><em>50 Shades of Grey</em></a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve obviously been hearing about this trilogy for some time now, but never really considered reading it until I saw Barbara Walters interview of her most fascinating people of the year. When Ms. Walters admitted that SHE read the books, I thought, OK, I can totally handle this. So, over the Christmas holidays when my hubby, toddler, and I were <del>bored to tears with no television and in the middle of nowhere</del> visiting my MIL, I thought it would be a good time to start reading said books&#8230;</p>
<p>HOLY SHIT BALLS (technical term), I could literally not put the book down! Within a week I had read the first 2 books read and had started on the 3rd. Whew, I am now completely finished and telling everyone I can think of to read these books. Don&#8217;t be afraid of the whole BDSM thing, that&#8217;s not the main part of the story&#8230;.READ IT!</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll thank me, E.L James, and start begging Hollywood to make the movie already! 🙂</p>

<p>Yes, I am going to talk about that recent (or maybe it was last year, but who knows because I&#8217;m always behind the literary times) book phenom: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0345803485/?tag=weea-20+shades+of+gray" target="_blank"><em>50 Shades of Grey</em></a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve obviously been hearing about this trilogy for some time now, but never really considered reading it until I saw Barbara Walters interview of her most fascinating people of the year. When Ms. Walters admitted that SHE read the books, I thought, OK, I can totally handle this. So, over the Christmas holidays when my hubby, toddler, and I were <del>bored to tears with no television and in the middle of nowhere</del> visiting my MIL, I thought it would be a good time to start reading said books&#8230;</p>
<p>HOLY SHIT BALLS (technical term), I could literally not put the book down! Within a week I had read the first 2 books read and had started on the 3rd. Whew, I am now completely finished and telling everyone I can think of to read these books. Don&#8217;t be afraid of the whole BDSM thing, that&#8217;s not the main part of the story&#8230;.READ IT!</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll thank me, E.L James, and start begging Hollywood to make the movie already! 🙂</p>
