The email took me to this website: <a href="http://www.bhldn.com/">http://www.bhldn.com/</a>.</p>
<p>So, what I can gather is this line will launch February 14th (awww, the day of l-o-v-e), and I cannot WAIT. I wonder what the price points will be, I wonder what the styles will be, and I wonder how accessible these dresses will be!?!?!?!</p>
<p>What are your immediate thoughts about Anthropologie doing weddings?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>We have our first The Tipsy Wedding Project update for you!!  We begin in pure Tipsy fashion with the drink that Christen chose.  If you&#8217;ll <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/05/hump-day-happy-hour-meets-the-tipsy-wedding-project/">recall</a> we gave our suggestions and then asked for yours.</p>
<p>Christen and Ed picked a madras to serve to their guests and decided to name it after one of the ideas our commenters threw at them, the &#8220;Fall in Love&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Madras</strong><br />
1 oz orange juice<br />
1.5 oz vodka<br />
3 oz cranberry<br />
garnish with an orange slice!</p>
<p>(served on the rocks in a cocktail glass)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the backstory Christen gave us on the drink decision:</p>
<blockquote><p>We started playing around with some of the recipes provided by you Tipsy gals, which was really fun, as you can imagine!  We&#8217;d mix up ingredients and try different combos, but never really hit on a clear choice.  Then I rememered how much I like the madras.  So I mixed one up for me, one for Ed and he agreed it was tasty!  We didn&#8217;t want something too girly-pink or too hardcore (like a martini) and this was a good medium.  The color was fun, we could easily garnish with an orange slice, and it was easy enough for the bartender to make in batches and serve up.  Winner!</p></blockquote>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>As my 3 year wedding anniversary approaches, I have found myself day dreaming of our special day, and one in particular detail: my wedding dress!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not like most people, I did not find the wedding dress shopping experience to be fun; rather, I kinda hated every minute of it&#8230;(other than the good friends, good lunch, and even better champagne.) So after a disastrous experience, I took to the interwebs in search of my dream dress. Where did I find it? Only my favorite &#8220;Go To&#8221; store of all time, <a href="http://www.jcrew.com/index.jsp" target="_blank">JCrew</a>!</p>
<p>If you are a bride-to-be, don&#8217;t be afraid to order your dress online. Most places have free shipping AND returns, and feel free to order several and have a fashion show in the privacy of your own home! I would totally have a fashion show with these beauties&#8230;</p>

	<p>As my 3 year wedding anniversary approaches, I have found myself day dreaming of our special day, and one in particular detail: my wedding dress!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not like most people, I did not find the wedding dress shopping experience to be fun; rather, I kinda hated every minute of it&#8230;(other than the good friends, good lunch, and even better champagne.) So after a disastrous experience, I took to the interwebs in search of my dream dress. Where did I find it? Only my favorite &#8220;Go To&#8221; store of all time, <a href="http://www.jcrew.com/index.jsp" target="_blank">JCrew</a>!</p>
<p>If you are a bride-to-be, don&#8217;t be afraid to order your dress online. Most places have free shipping AND returns, and feel free to order several and have a fashion show in the privacy of your own home! I would totally have a fashion show with these beauties&#8230;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Hey Christen! So we know you&#8217;ve got a wedding coming up pretty soon and we thought we&#8217;d let you know what the readers picked for you in all genres we came up with.  I think it all looks pretty snazzy if I do say so myself!</p>
<ol>
<li>AK-<a href="http://www.stylemepretty.com/2009/10/20/fall-flower-inspiration-by-jessicas-country-flowers/">This bouquet</a> is so RICH in color and I believe that’s what Christen is going for.  This combines roses, lilies (calla), and a tiny bit of hydrangea.  I love the berries and seeded eucalyptus which can be incorporated into some badass boutonnieres when we get to those.</li>
<li>Sarah-I love this <a href="http://www.weddingpaperdivas.com/product/4918/signature_white_textured_wedding_invitations_fresh_flourish.html" target="_blank">invite</a> because it’s simple with a touch of modern romance!</li>
<li>AK-Very simple, mini calla to tie in the bride’s bouquet with a little bit of a twist of that twine stuff or whatever it is.  LOVE IT.</li>
<li>Der-<a href="http://www.zappos.com/product/7635167/color/535">These</a> are cute and orange and would totally be reusable later on with a par-TAY dress! I did apple green shoes under my wedding dress, but they were dyed and therefore unable to be worn in wet conditions.. BOO!!  and her groom could wear <a href="http://www1.bloomingdales.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=484865&amp;CategoryID=11257&amp;cm_mmc=ShopStyle-_-LINKSHARE-_-Crawl-_-Crawl&amp;PartnerID=LINKSHARE&amp;LinkshareID=J84DHJLQkR4-ra.1xXg1Si89if2QRTDhhA">these</a>.</li>
<li>Court-My idea for the <a href="http://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-photos/centerpieces/orange/seasons/bbca4a511e24d292-13923e65bbf9a65f-3.html">centerpieces</a> is heavily influenced by the centerpiece/florals at Der’s wedding.  I love the mixture of <a href="../2010/01/fruitty-floral-arrangement/">fruit and floral</a>.  You can work in whatever flowers you choose at the top or the base and include whole oranges or slices.  I think its comes off so elegant and FUN.</li>
<li>Der-<a href="http://www.papertastebuds.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/thank-you-card-paperfinger.jpg">This</a> is something I WISH I would have done at my wedding! So easy.. just find two seconds (easier said than done) in your busy reception time hold the sign saying Thank You and voila! Turn it into super adorable thank you cards for all those wedding gifts that you rake in!</li>
<li>Der-I did cookie favors in our wedding colors with our last initial on them and they were quite the hit. The taste testing part is pretty much awesome too. You can either have them at each place setting or do a pass out situation when guests are leaving.</li>
<li>Sarah-I LOVE this. <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/9596493/custom-ring-bearer-bowl-tm-by-palomas">It’s</a> not as cheesy as a pillow and it’s something the bride and groom can keep forever!</li>
<li>Sarah-I would choose either the <a href="http://ninashoes.com/critia-ruby--14072">yellow or red shoe</a> to wear with the bridesmaids dresses. These are fun, sassy, and tie into the fall colors nicely.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks everybody for voting! Christen &amp; Ed, Best Wishes from the Tipsy Gals!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve all got a few ideas of things for Christen&#8217;s wedding that we couldn&#8217;t quite categorize, so we are just going to call them &#8220;special touches&#8221;.</p>
<ol>
<li>Der-<a href="http://www.papertastebuds.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/thank-you-card-paperfinger.jpg">This</a> is something I WISH I would have done at my wedding!

<li>AK-I wish I had done <a href="http://media.theknot.com/ImageStage/Objects/0003/0059155/large_image.jpg">this</a> at my wedding&#8230;Too cute to have an ampersand hanging from the Bride &amp; Groom&#8217;s chairs.  I think I would have done the ampersand at my wedding covered in Zinnias.  Christen could do hers in moss or maybe orange mum flowers.  So pretty!</li>
<li>Sarah-After the reception is over, the getaway makes for a great photo-op. My sister used sparklers at her late September wedding and the pictures turned out to be some of the best from the entire day&#8230;they are inexpensive and a great way to end a fabulous day!</li>
<li>Court-I love the personal touch of having guests <a href="http://www.brendasweddingblog.com/storage/wedding-outlet-guest-books.jpg">sign a picture</a> frame or plate, something the couple can keep and cherish for their lifetime.  Most people I know that have done this have this out and part of their decor in their house.  Its such a cute reminder of that special day.</li>

<p>2. AK-Fall colors! Also I love the idea of finding seeds of flowers you are using in your bouquets and allowing everyone to plant the flowers from your big day.  Then every time they bloom, your guests will remember your big day!</p>
<p>3. Court-I LOVE this idea (and wine&#8211;have I said that 85 times before?) Cute, fall themed, usable by most, etc.</p>
<p>4. Der-I did cookie favors in our wedding colors with our last initial on them and they were quite the hit. The taste testing part is pretty much awesome too. You can either have them at each place setting or do a pass out situation when guests are leaving.</p>

<p>4. Der-I did cookie favors in our wedding colors with our last initial on them and they were quite the hit. The taste testing part is pretty much awesome too. You can either have them at each place setting or do a pass out situation when guests are leaving.</p>

<li>AK-I love the idea of the pumpkins being part of the <a href="http://teenyblessings.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/pumpkin-centerpiece-msw.jpg">centerpiece</a> since it&#8217;s fall.  I&#8217;d probably incorporate less white flowers and more vivid fall oranges and burgundy.</li>
<li>Sarah-I like the idea of using these two centerpieces and alternating them among tables. The simplicity of the potted marigolds add to the rustic feel of Christen&#8217;s wedding and they will be VERY budget-friendly in October. I also fell in love with the flowers in the orange vase because a) it will add just a slight touch of modern to the rustic charm of the marigolds and b) the rosemary that is also used in this arrangement is a sign of remembrance that could be used to honor the loved ones that could not be with you on your special day! (I found the thought about the rosemeary on <a href="http://theknot.com/" target="_blank">theknot.com</a>, but it was totally worth sharing!)</li>
<li>Court-My idea for the <a href="http://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-photos/centerpieces/orange/seasons/bbca4a511e24d292-13923e65bbf9a65f-3.html">centerpieces</a> is heavily influenced by the centerpiece/florals at Der&#8217;s wedding.  I love the mixture of <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/01/fruitty-floral-arrangement/">fruit and floral</a>.  You can work in whatever flowers you choose at the top or the base and include whole oranges or slices.  I think its comes off so elegant and FUN.</li>
<li>Der-I love the rich colors in <a href="http://www.cheapweddingcenterpieces.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/floral-centerpieces.jpg">this centerpiece</a> and unique combo of flowers. I think it would be super sweet to add some oranges or orange slices in this vase too.</li>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Today we are going to cover the ring bearer&#8230;I thought I&#8217;d share a little of what Christen was looking for, which is something unique and not a normal ring bearer pillow.</p>
<blockquote><p>My supremely awesome 4 year old brother, Evan, is our ring bearer.  He is very excited for the wedding and said he watched a cartoon where &#8220;a boy was in a wedding and I saw him carry the rings so I know what to do!&#8221;  I love that kid SO MUCH.  Anyway, I&#8217;ve never been a huge fan of the pillow for the rings.  Maybe it&#8217;s because, while Evan is a pretty sensitive soul, he&#8217;s a rough and tumble boy who plays the drums (with his shirt off, natch) so having him carry the rings on a pillow just doesn&#8217;t seem natural.  Then again, it&#8217;s not like anyone walks around with rings on pillows.  Any alternate ideas?  I&#8217;ve been cruising wedding sites looking for something and am coming up empty.</p></blockquote>
<p>So here goes&#8230;these are our suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Court-Take a <a href="http://www.thecraftbarn.co.uk/shopimages/products/thumbnails/rect%20box.jpg">small wooden box</a>, cover with orange flowers.  You can also put green moss on the inside for a little extra touch.</li>
<li>Sarah-I LOVE this. <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/9596493/custom-ring-bearer-bowl-tm-by-palomas">It&#8217;s</a> not as cheesy as a pillow and it&#8217;s something the bride and groom can keep forever!</li>
<li>AK-A <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/48526135/autumn-leaf-moss-ring-bearer-pillow">pillow</a> made from moss with a fall leaf and some twine&#8211;LOVE IT!</li>
<li>Der-I&#8217;m kind of in love with this <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/44301910/beautiful-3d-rose-ring-bearer-pillow-in">ring bearer pillow</a>. It would actually be really easy to make yourself and look really gorgeous in rich fall oranges and browns instead of blue.</li>
