		<description><![CDATA[<p>This where I insert my excuse for going MIA for a number of monthsÂ ðŸ™‚Â  Life happens, right?Â  But this is a great post that&#8217;s always fun to do and lets me verbal vomit about my life in the last year.Â  So here goes it&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>1. What did you do in 2011 that youâ€™d never done before?</strong></p>
<p>Entered and completed a 10k and lived to write about it.Â  HAHAA.</p>
<p><strong>2. Did you keep your new yearâ€™s resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</strong></p>
<p>I would say that I didn&#8217;t technically meet my resolution of losing the amount of weight that I wanted, but IÂ am pumped for the new year.</p>
<p><strong>3. Did anyone close to you give birth? </strong></p>
<p>OMG did they ever.Â  Sarah and AK both in one year.Â  It&#8217;s been a lot of baby talk round these parts.</p>
<p><strong>4. Did anyone close to you die?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I had a cousin pass in July.Â  Very sad situation that really rattled my family.Â  Unfortunately my Aunt also died just last month while in the hospital under going heart surgery.Â  You just have to buckle down as a family and push through the good and the bad.Â  There was more bad this year than I would have liked.</p>
<p><strong>5. What countries did you visit?</strong></p>
<p>JAMAICA BABY.Â  Ben&#8217;s sis got married in Montego Bay and we were able to have a really badass vacation there in turn.Â  Snorkling was my favorite activity there.</p>
<p><strong>6. What would you like to have in 2012 that you didnâ€™t have in 2011?</strong></p>
<p>A siamese cat that magically gets over his little man, I hate every other cat in the house so I am going to piss in a pile of clothes act.</p>
<p><strong>7. What dates from 2011 will be etched upon your memory, and why?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately my cousins death on July 27, 2011.Â  We were very close for a number of years and again, just took the whole thing pretty hard.Â  It was a very senseless situation.</p>
<p>I hate that the one thing that sticks out in my mind is a really bad event, but its what I think of first.</p>
<p><strong>8. What was your biggest achievement of this year?</strong></p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t entirely complete because the school is not over, but&#8230;.volunteering to be and acting as homeroom mom.Â  With that comes organization of all class parties and field day.Â  It&#8217;s also given me more time with Austin at a time when he is really starting to naturally become more independent. Â  So far is been a lot of fun and I&#8217;ve been able to be front row for all of Austin&#8217;s activities at school.</p>
<p><strong>9. What was your biggest failure?</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have anything that I look back and said that I completely failed on.Â  There are times I have acted in ways that I shouldn&#8217;t have though.</p>
<p><strong>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</strong></p>
<p>If sick is being defined as an illness or injury that actually had you down,Â  I do not believe I was sick one single time in 2011.Â  Tipsy ladies, feel free to correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p><strong>11. What was the best thing you bought?</strong></p>
<p>A new TV for our bedroom.Â  I had thought before that I really didn&#8217;t care about TVs, until I got a nice upgraded one to watch my Law and Orders on.</p>
<p><strong>12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</strong></p>
<p>Ben was great with all the deaths and goings on this year.Â  You know simple things like just sitting with someone at the hospital or in a funeral service make the world of difference.Â  You know that you have someone there that is giving you 100% of their support.</p>
<p>Another person that has totally blown me away is my dear friend Der.Â  Its been pretty amazing watching her take a natural gift and be able to turn into a career that makes everyone of her customers so happy.Â  Shes truly got something good going there.</p>
<p><strong>13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?</strong></p>
<p>Blah.</p>
<p><strong>14. Where did most your money go? </strong></p>
<p>Its honestly felt like Austin ate, literally ate in food, my paycheck.Â  What little was left went to Austin&#8217;s first football season.Â  What a great experience and GREAT people watching.Â  Soccer was nothing compared to these characters.</p>
<p><strong>15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?</strong></p>
<p>I did/am totally wrapped up in the excitement of watching my best friends with their babies.Â  Its been a lot of fun to see all tha&#8217; boys and its also fun that we are all boy moms now, some of us for the second time.Â  Its a very special club.</p>
<p><strong>16. What song will always remind you of 2011?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;What Sarah Said&#8221; by Death Cab for Cutie</p>
<p><strong>17.</strong> <strong>Compared to this time last year, are you: a) happier or sadder? b) thinner or fatter? c) richer or poorer?</strong></p>
<p>Happier still.Â  It&#8217;s still been a fun year and I have the best people in my life.</p>
<p>Actually if you get down to technicalities, I am thinner&#8211;but not by much!</p>
<p>Same.</p>
<p><strong>18. What do you wish youâ€™d done more of?</strong></p>
<p>Traveling.Â  Its so nice to get out and see new places and experience new things.Â  I want to do more of that in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>19. What do you wish youâ€™d done less of?</strong></p>
<p>Worrying about things I can&#8217;t change.</p>
<p><strong>20. How did you spend Christmas?</strong></p>
<p>In Houston with my family and Ben&#8217;s family.Â  Christmas Eve is at my parents place with all of my Mom&#8217;s side of the family.Â  Its a fun and extremely loud and obnoxious gathering.Â  One of my Aunts threatened to &#8220;slap the shit&#8221; out of another one of my Aunts this year, so that&#8217;s always a good laugh.</p>
<p><strong>21. Did you fall in love with 2011?</strong></p>
<p>I think in any relationship you continue to get closer and closer when its going good.Â  So I would definitely say with Ben.Â  CHEESE BALL!</p>
<p><strong>22. What was your favorite TV program?</strong></p>
<p>DUDE&#8230;.I seriously have an issue.Â  All I watch is Law and Order on DVDs.Â  Now that I have been through all of the Law and Order: SVUs,Â  I have moved on to the orignal Law and Orders.Â  I am seriously an addict.</p>
<p><strong>23. Do you hate anyone now that you didnâ€™t hate this time last year?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>24. What was the best book you read?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely fell head over heels for the Hunger Games Trilogy.</p>
<p><strong>25. What was your greatest musical discovery?</strong></p>
<p>Sarah Jaffe.Â Actually Ben discovered her for me and took me to a concert.Â  She&#8217;s amazing and a REALLY chill.</p>
<p><strong>26. What did you want and get?</strong></p>
<p>You know I decided to look for a job in January of 2011 and in less than a month I landed a job that I absolutely love.Â  I think that was my best catch this year.</p>
<p><strong>27. What did you want and not get?</strong></p>
<p>Nothing I can even think of.</p>
<p><strong>28. What was your favorite film of 2010?</strong></p>
<p>I am going to go with&#8230;.Limitless.Â  It had me tuned in from the second it started.</p>
<p><strong>29. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</strong></p>
<p>On my 31st birthday Ben took me to a concert and then surprised me with a bunch of my friends that were already at a bar waiting for me to ring in the big 3-1.Â  I really felt like it was &#8220;my day&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>30. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</strong></p>
<p>I think a TAD more organization would have helped.Â  I don&#8217; think I am in immense need, butÂ I started off the new year by organizaing all of my jewelry.Â  My next battle is my closet.Â  So I have high hopes to get more organized. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p><strong>31. How would you describe your personal fashion concept of 2010?</strong></p>
<p>Patterns and bangles.Â  I did a lot of thrift shopping this year as well.</p>
<p><strong>32. What kept you sane?</strong></p>
<p>The good and bad and up and downs of raising and being as involved as I can with Austin.Â  Its been work for Ben and I together as well.Â  Its definitely a learning process that never stops.</p>
<p><strong>33. What political issue stirred you the most?</strong></p>
<p>When that TV reporter had some type of seizure or something and was talking all crazy.Â  That stirred me real good.Â  Google it.Â  Thank me later.</p>
<p><strong>34. Who did you miss?</strong></p>
<p>I miss working my old co-workers, they were a really fun crew.Â  They have all also moved on to other jobs since then as well.Â  Its just so important to have people that make you laugh, you can talk to and rely on at work.Â  I spend more time at work than anywhere else, so that kind of thing is important to me.</p>
<p><strong>35. Who was the best new person you met?</strong></p>
<p>On Austin&#8217;s football team there are twin boys (age 10) that we have gotten to know during this year.Â  I have to say they are so damn cool and have a way of making you look at things in a totally different perspective.Â  They have two of the sweetest personalities and couldn&#8217;t have a better outlook on things, considering that haven&#8217;t had the best home life.</p>
<p><strong>36. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2011.</strong></p>
<p>That you really should try to make the best of each relationship, day, conversation.</p>
<p><strong>37. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year.</strong></p>
<p><em>Love is watching someone die.â€” Death Cab for Cutie</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>17.</strong> <strong>Compared to this time last year, are you: a) happier or sadder? b) thinner or fatter? c) richer or poorer?</strong></p>
<p>Happier still.Â  It&#8217;s still been a fun year and I have the best people in my life.</p>
<p>Actually if you get down to technicalities, I am thinner&#8211;but not by much!</p>
<p>Same.</p>
<p><strong>18. What do you wish youâ€™d done more of?</strong></p>
<p>Traveling.Â  Its so nice to get out and see new places and experience new things.Â  I want to do more of that in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>19. What do you wish youâ€™d done less of?</strong></p>
<p>Worrying about things I can&#8217;t change.</p>
<p><strong>20. How did you spend Christmas?</strong></p>
<p>In Houston with my family and Ben&#8217;s family.Â  Christmas Eve is at my parents place with all of my Mom&#8217;s side of the family.Â  Its a fun and extremely loud and obnoxious gathering.Â  One of my Aunts threatened to &#8220;slap the shit&#8221; out of another one of my Aunts this year, so that&#8217;s always a good laugh.</p>
<p><strong>21. Did you fall in love with 2011?</strong></p>
<p>I think in any relationship you continue to get closer and closer when its going good.Â  So I would definitely say with Ben.Â  CHEESE BALL!</p>
<p><strong>22. What was your favorite TV program?</strong></p>
<p>DUDE&#8230;.I seriously have an issue.Â  All I watch is Law and Order on DVDs.Â  Now that I have been through all of the Law and Order: SVUs,Â  I have moved on to the orignal Law and Orders.Â  I am seriously an addict.</p>
<p><strong>23. Do you hate anyone now that you didnâ€™t hate this time last year?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>24. What was the best book you read?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely fell head over heels for the Hunger Games Trilogy.</p>
<p><strong>25. What was your greatest musical discovery?</strong></p>
<p>Sarah Jaffe.Â Actually Ben discovered her for me and took me to a concert.Â  She&#8217;s amazing and a REALLY chill.</p>
<p><strong>26. What did you want and get?</strong></p>
<p>You know I decided to look for a job in January of 2011 and in less than a month I landed a job that I absolutely love.Â  I think that was my best catch this year.</p>
<p><strong>27. What did you want and not get?</strong></p>
<p>Nothing I can even think of.</p>
<p><strong>28. What was your favorite film of 2010?</strong></p>
<p>I am going to go with&#8230;.Limitless.Â  It had me tuned in from the second it started.</p>
<p><strong>29. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</strong></p>
<p>On my 31st birthday Ben took me to a concert and then surprised me with a bunch of my friends that were already at a bar waiting for me to ring in the big 3-1.Â  I really felt like it was &#8220;my day&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>30. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</strong></p>
<p>I think a TAD more organization would have helped.Â  I don&#8217; think I am in immense need, butÂ I started off the new year by organizaing all of my jewelry.Â  My next battle is my closet.Â  So I have high hopes to get more organized. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p><strong>31. How would you describe your personal fashion concept of 2010?</strong></p>
<p>Patterns and bangles.Â  I did a lot of thrift shopping this year as well.</p>
<p><strong>32. What kept you sane?</strong></p>
<p>The good and bad and up and downs of raising and being as involved as I can with Austin.Â  Its been work for Ben and I together as well.Â  Its definitely a learning process that never stops.</p>
<p><strong>33. What political issue stirred you the most?</strong></p>
<p>When that TV reporter had some type of seizure or something and was talking all crazy.Â  That stirred me real good.Â  Google it.Â  Thank me later.</p>
<p><strong>34. Who did you miss?</strong></p>
<p>I miss working my old co-workers, they were a really fun crew.Â  They have all also moved on to other jobs since then as well.Â  Its just so important to have people that make you laugh, you can talk to and rely on at work.Â  I spend more time at work than anywhere else, so that kind of thing is important to me.</p>
<p><strong>35. Who was the best new person you met?</strong></p>
<p>On Austin&#8217;s football team there are twin boys (age 10) that we have gotten to know during this year.Â  I have to say they are so damn cool and have a way of making you look at things in a totally different perspective.Â  They have two of the sweetest personalities and couldn&#8217;t have a better outlook on things, considering that haven&#8217;t had the best home life.</p>
<p><strong>36. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2011.</strong></p>
<p>That you really should try to make the best of each relationship, day, conversation.</p>
<p><strong>37. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year.</strong></p>
<p><em>Love is watching someone die.â€” Death Cab for Cutie</em></p>

<p><strong>30. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</strong></p>
<p>Less stress of the little things. Â Who ever said don&#8217;t sweat the small stuff is so true.</p>
<p><strong>31. How would you describe your personal fashion concept of 2010?</strong></p>
<p>Sporty Spice! Â Casual sneakers and tees with some cute earrings.</p>
<p><strong>32. What kept you sane?</strong></p>
<p>Ben, my kittahs and concerts. Â I have to give most of the cred to Ben though. Â He&#8217;s my rock.</p>
<p><strong>33. What political issue stirred you the most?</strong></p>
<p>Ummm, it didn&#8217;t stir me per say, but seeing the first African American president in office has been great.</p>
<p><strong>34. Who did you miss?</strong></p>
<p>Aus when he had to spend extended visits at his dad&#8217;s.</p>
<p><strong>35. Who was the best new person you met?</strong></p>
<p>I met a lot of great new co-workers in 2010.</p>
<p><strong>36. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2010.</strong></p>
<p>Laugh A LOT more!</p>
<p><strong>37. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year.</strong></p>
<p><em>I am yours now<br />
So now I don&#8217;t ever have to leave<br />
I&#8217;ve been found out<br />
So now I&#8217;ll never explore<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>-The XX </em></p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I never make New Year&#8217;s Resolutions. Ever.Â  But I thought, you know, we are going into this year a little different than any year before and I thought, why not.Â  I think it&#8217;ll be fun to look back and see if I could pull any of this off in a year.Â  So here goes:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1817" title="ak-resolutions" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/ak-resolutions.png" alt="ak-resolutions" width="500" height="768" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/ak-resolutions.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/ak-resolutions-195x300.png 195w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Try and take a <a href="http://www.zappos.com/new-balance-wr769-pink">walk</a> with the kiddo every day if weather allows.</li>
<li>Learn to sew, like for real with my new Christmas gift.Â  My ultimate goal:Â  a <a href="http://www.jellybeanquilts.com/samples.htm">baby clothes memory quilt</a>.</li>
<li>Implement some sort of regularly occurring date night that went to shit when we had our bouncing baby boy.</li>
<li>Get back into <a href="http://www.amcentertainment.com/">going to more movies</a> SOMEHOW, SOMEWAY!Â  My mom and I used to go to a movie every Sunday pre-bebe and pre-2009.Â  I need my theater watching experience por favor.</li>
<li>Organize!Â  Organize the junk drawer in the kitchen, organize the closets in the extra bedroom and finally organize my closet (trying on clothes and seeing what actually fits and doesn&#8217;t). (and just FYI that&#8217;s not my closet, you don&#8217;t want to see it)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Read more</a> and when I say more, like maybe a whole book.Â  Magazines don&#8217;t count.Â  Google Reader doesn&#8217;t count.Â  I may even go so far as to go for 10 books in 2010.</li>
