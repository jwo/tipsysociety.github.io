		<description><![CDATA[<p>We received a comment on our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/tipsysociety" target="_blank">Facebook</a> page recently asking about some inexpensive options for a  &#8220;Denim and Diamonds&#8221; themed party, and here&#8217;s what we came up with!</p>
<ul>
<li>Mason jars w/ tea lights:  from <a href="http://emmalinebride.com/handmade-wedding/mason-jar-centerpieces-floating-candles/" target="_blank">http://emmalinebride.com/handmade-wedding/mason-jar-centerpieces-floating-candles/</a>. We would replace those clear marbles with diamondy things.</li>
<li> Baby&#8217;s breath in galvanized tubs (large or small): from <a href="http://global.theknot.com/join/MemberLogin.aspx?target=http%3a%2f%2fweddings.theknot.com%2fReal-Weddings%2f85011%2fdetailview.aspx%3fSTOPREDIRECTING%3dTRUE%26id%3d85011%26type%3d3%26wedding%2bdetails%3dceremony%2bdecor%26PgReferrer%3d" target="_blank">theknot.com</a>. After all, baby&#8217;s breath is CHEAP!</li>
<li>Flowers in vintage cans: from <a href="http://peacockfeatherevents.blogspot.com/2009/10/wedding-wild-flowers.html" target="_blank">http://peacockfeatherevents.blogspot.com/2009/10/wedding-wild-flowers.html</a>. You could also just take regular cans and cover the cans with either scrapbook or brown paper, which might be easier to find if you don&#8217;t have vintage cans on hand.</li>
<li>Flowers, curly willow, and raffia in clear vases: from <a href="http://jenelisebeth.blogspot.com/2009/07/etsy-martha-stewart-handmade-weddings.html" target="_blank">http://jenelisebeth.blogspot.com/2009/07/etsy-martha-stewart-handmade-weddings.html</a>. We would replace the yellow with something that matches the colors of the party.</li>
<li>Mason jars, twine, and flowers: from <a href="http://wedding.allwomenstalk.com/5-rustic-wedding-centerpiece-ideas/" target="_blank">http://wedding.allwomenstalk.com/5-rustic-wedding-centerpiece-ideas/</a>.</li>
</ul>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I just read Jennie&#8217;s <a href="http://www.shelikespurple.com/shelikespurple/2011/08/my-typical-day.html">post</a> over at She Likes Purple regarding her typical day and loved it and thought I&#8217;d play along as well!</p>
<p><strong>6:00a</strong> Hank (our almost 4 month old) starts stirring, I get up and go get him and bring him in bed with my husband and I and sometimes he&#8217;ll fall back asleep until my almost 3 year old, Jack, starts waking up.</p>
<p><strong>6:45-7a</strong> Jack is for sure awake by this point. We all file downstairs. My husband, Jesse, gives Hank a bottle while I fix Jack his breakfast and fix my husband and I some form of caffeinated beverage.</p>
<p><strong>7:30a</strong> Jack starts playing with his cars and Jesse and I fix our breakfasts while Hank swings or bounces in some sort of contraption.</p>
<p><strong>7:45a</strong> Hank is thoroughly over said contraption and hopefully one of us has snarfed their cereal down fast enough to go change up his scenery.</p>
<p><strong>8:00a</strong> Jesse, who works from home, generally tells us &#8220;goodbye&#8221; and heads back upstairs to start his work day. We resume car playing.</p>
<p><strong>9:00a</strong> We load the cars up and head upstairs where Jack plays while I get Hank down for a nap.  This generally involves Jack running back and forth between Hank&#8217;s room and the game room in a LOUD whisper asking me what I&#8217;m doing, what&#8217;s Baby Hank doing, which Cars 2 racer is from Spain, Japan, England, Italy, etc etc.</p>
<p><strong>9:20a-ish</strong> Jack and I head back downstairs for his second breakfast of yogurt and blueberries.</p>
<p><strong>9:40-9:45a</strong> Hank wakes up. Sometimes he&#8217;s happy, sometimes not.</p>
<p><strong>10:00a-10:15a</strong> Bottle for Hank. Jack is asking me about (Cars 2) Finn McMissile and Holley Shiftwell and Grem and Acer and Professor Z and what they are doing and where they are going and do they have engines and do they need car washes.</p>
<p><strong>10:16a </strong>Change Hank&#8217;s poopy diaper</p>
<p><strong>10:20-11:00a</strong> At this point we generally get &#8220;the big phone&#8221; (the iPad) out and either do some puzzles, read stories or practice writing letters with some of the apps.  Hank is either happily screeching in my lap or swinging or in the jumperoo.</p>
<p><strong>11:00a</strong> Jesse comes downstairs. I fix Jack&#8217;s lunch and Jesse fixes our lunch.</p>
<p><strong>11:30a</strong> Just as Jesse is putting our lunches down on the table, Hank is ready for a nap.  I head back upstairs to get Hank down. Jack finishes up lunch with Jesse downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>12:00p</strong> Jesse usually takes Jack up and reads a couple of stories and gets him down for his nap. And I try and get my lunch in at this point.  This is also the point in time where I attempt to do some sort of laundry or pay bills or read email or if I&#8217;m lucky get through some blogs on Google Reader.</p>
<p><strong>1:00-1:30p</strong> Jesse heads to the gym. Hank wakes up sometime around now.  Bottle time!</p>
<p><strong>1:31p</strong> Change Hank&#8217;s poopy diaper.</p>
<p><strong>1:45-2:00p</strong> Jack wakes up.  I run upstairs and get him and we come back downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>2:00p-3:00p </strong>We generally need a snack and a Team Umizoomi or Bubble Guppies or Curious George or SOMETHING. We build car dealerships with legos, or oil derricks, or giant car washes. And I NEED caffeine.</p>
<p><strong>3:00p </strong>Hank is ready for a nap.  We head upstairs and I turn on Mister Rogers where they explain how they make crayons and Jack is fascinated by this process. However, in general we repeat what happens at 9a where Jack is running back and forth between Hank&#8217;s room and the game room and in a LOUD whisper is asking me what I&#8217;m doing, what&#8217;s Baby Hank doing, which Cars 2 racer is from Spain, Japan, England, Italy, etc etc.</p>
<p><strong>3:40-3:45p</strong> Hank wakes up, we head back downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>4:00p</strong> Bottle Time!</p>
<p><strong>4:16p</strong> Change Hank&#8217;s poopy diaper.</p>
<p><strong>4:20-4:30p </strong>I ask Jack if he wants to go get the mail, he says no.  I get the keys and we all head outside to get the mail. Come inside drenched in sweat and heat rash already forming on Jack. I&#8217;m swearing under my breath about how hot it is as we walk back inside.</p>
<p><strong>4:30p-5:00p</strong> Jesse heads downstairs. I try and fit in a trip to the gym.</p>
<p><strong>5:00-5:30p</strong> We all sit down to eat dinner.</p>
<p><strong>5:30p</strong> Hank goes down for a nap.</p>
<p><strong>6:00p</strong> Hank is up!</p>
<p><strong>6:00-7:00p</strong> Dance parties and piggy back rides!</p>
<p><strong>6:45p</strong> Hank is PISSED that he is still downstairs and you people aren&#8217;t taking him up for a bath and a bottle and bedtime.  He voices this loudly. Jesse heads up with Hank and does that routine.</p>
<p><strong>7:00p-8:00p</strong> Jack and I head upstairs.  He takes a bath, then we go and read 2 or 3 or 4 books depending on how persuasive he is.  Then we have some Cars 2 talk.  Then lights out.</p>
<p><strong>8:00p</strong> I shower and then head downstairs to do the dishes.</p>
<p><strong>8:30p </strong>We settle in downstairs and watch whatever we have recorded on TiVo and Jesse works.</p>
<p><strong>10:00p</strong> Head upstairs and give Hank a bottle and watch a Friends rerun.</p>
<p><strong>10:30p-11:30</strong> Pass out from exhaustion.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s my day.  And that&#8217;s just a regular at home day, not a day when we have somewhere to go.  What&#8217;s your typical day?</p>

<p><strong>7:00p-8:00p</strong> Jack and I head upstairs.  He takes a bath, then we go and read 2 or 3 or 4 books depending on how persuasive he is.  Then we have some Cars 2 talk.  Then lights out.</p>
<p><strong>8:00p</strong> I shower and then head downstairs to do the dishes.</p>
<p><strong>8:30p </strong>We settle in downstairs and watch whatever we have recorded on TiVo and Jesse works.</p>
<p><strong>10:00p</strong> Head upstairs and give Hank a bottle and watch a Friends rerun.</p>
<p><strong>10:30p-11:30</strong> Pass out from exhaustion.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s my day.  And that&#8217;s just a regular at home day, not a day when we have somewhere to go.  What&#8217;s your typical day?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>This past weekend I joined Tipsy ladies Court and Der on their annual trip to the big antiques/craft show in Round Top, Tx. Unfortunately, the other half of the Tipsy Society were unable to attend due to all the babies being born around here.  We drank too much beer, spent too much money, and ultimately had a blast. Here are some memories from that day&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8028" title="mc-rt1" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mc-rt1.png" alt="" width="500" height="334" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mc-rt1.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mc-rt1-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>We learned from the lady at the gas station, who may or may not have been drinking on the job, that Round Top is officially the smallest town in Texas</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8029" title="mc-rt2" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mc-rt2.png" alt="" width="500" height="648" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mc-rt2.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mc-rt2-231x300.png 231w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>Court obtained a new tool to go along with her mini champagne, and a cute new wristlet.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8027" title="mc-rt3" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mc-rt3.png" alt="" width="500" height="656" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mc-rt3.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mc-rt3-228x300.png 228w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>We came prepared with a travel beer cooler to help us make it through the day.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8026" title="mc-rt4" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mc-rt4.png" alt="" width="500" height="420" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mc-rt4.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mc-rt4-300x252.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>Court hesitated about this giant red bowl, and Der swooped in and bought it.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8025" title="mc-rt5" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mc-rt5.png" alt="" width="500" height="402" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mc-rt5.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mc-rt5-300x241.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>She also found a very cute personalized blanket for Aiden.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8024" title="mc-rt6" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mc-rt6.png" alt="" width="500" height="313" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mc-rt6.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mc-rt6-300x187.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>I found a cute little green end table for dirt cheap.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8023" title="mc-rt7" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mc-rt7.png" alt="" width="500" height="370" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mc-rt7.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mc-rt7-300x222.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>And Court splurged on a beaded cross cuff bracelet, which she talked about every 5 minutes for the rest of the day.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Over the weekend we&#8217;ll be implementing a new look and adding some new features to Tipsy Society! This has been a long time in the works and it&#8217;s finally here!  We just wanted to give you an idea of what to expect next week.</p>
<ol>
<li>First and foremost we&#8217;ll be changing up the look of the site.  Hopefully this will make things a little easier to navigate.</li>
<li>We will be adding a little bit of personal blogging for those of you that are interested in hearing about our crazy lives.  We can&#8217;t promise a post a day from each of us on this front but we definitely have some stories to tell, so look for Tipsy Story Time coming soon.</li>
<li>All of us have become somewhat addicted to Instagram, a photo sharing app on the iPhone, so we are going to be sharing our Instagrams with all of you.</li>
</ol>
<p>But! Don&#8217;t get scared, we are still going to be sharing with you what we love&#8230;all our finds on the internets!  We will still have all of our regular features ala Hump Day Happy Hour, $50 Fridays, Fabulous Footwear Friday.  And if you read us on an RSS reader you will be able to subscribe to whatever you would like.  So&#8230;bear with us as we transition over and for any hiccups that occur along the way.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>We thought we&#8217;d share a few pics from the baby shower we helped throw for Sarah and her hubby over the weekend.  Sarah and Kynn have decided to not find out if they are having a boy or girl ahead of time so we had to stick with a strictly gender neutral shower.  Dr. Seuss was the answer!  We couldn&#8217;t possibly get all the decor in these shots but hoooo boy was it cute!</p>
<p>We had Seuss cookies and cupcakes and Seuss themed flowers and Red Fish and Blue Fish&#8230;and the list goes on and on!  Instead of a sign in book, we had everyone sign in on a copy of &#8220;Oh, The Places You&#8217;ll Go&#8221;.  Throughout the house we used Seuss books and stuffed Seuss characters as decor.  We also played two games: Baby Animal Matchathon and Baby Price is Right.  Definitely fun games as they were both a bit challenging.  All in all I think everyone had fun and Sarah and Kynn got a ton of very cute baby stuff.  Congrats to Sarah &amp; Kynn! Can&#8217;t wait to meet the new addition!!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>We have our first The Tipsy Wedding Project update for you!!  We begin in pure Tipsy fashion with the drink that Christen chose.  If you&#8217;ll <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/05/hump-day-happy-hour-meets-the-tipsy-wedding-project/">recall</a> we gave our suggestions and then asked for yours.</p>
<p>Christen and Ed picked a madras to serve to their guests and decided to name it after one of the ideas our commenters threw at them, the &#8220;Fall in Love&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Madras</strong><br />
1 oz orange juice<br />
1.5 oz vodka<br />
3 oz cranberry<br />
garnish with an orange slice!</p>
<p>(served on the rocks in a cocktail glass)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the backstory Christen gave us on the drink decision:</p>
<blockquote><p>We started playing around with some of the recipes provided by you Tipsy gals, which was really fun, as you can imagine!  We&#8217;d mix up ingredients and try different combos, but never really hit on a clear choice.  Then I rememered how much I like the madras.  So I mixed one up for me, one for Ed and he agreed it was tasty!  We didn&#8217;t want something too girly-pink or too hardcore (like a martini) and this was a good medium.  The color was fun, we could easily garnish with an orange slice, and it was easy enough for the bartender to make in batches and serve up.  Winner!</p></blockquote>
