		<description><![CDATA[<p>Have you heard of <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/home">Fitbit</a>? It&#8217;s sorta like a pedometer in that it tracks your steps, but it does so much more than that.  My husband ordered Fitbits back in December for us. You wear the little tracker during the day as well as at night and it will track your steps, stairs climbed, calories, weight, and sleep.  There is an iPhone app that it works with where you can enter the food you eat throughout the day.  In addition they have a scale that syncs up with everything so you know your BMI.  You can set up weight loss goals and it will tell you what your calories should be for the day to lose weight by a certain period of time. You can also add how many glasses of water you&#8217;ve had.  </p>
<p>The MOST interesting aspect for me is how it tracks sleep. After having used the Fitbit for the last few months I have determined if I am awakened anytime between 12a and 2a I will definitely be dragging the next day.  If I somehow manage to not be awakened during that time I seem to be fine.  It&#8217;s quite interesting.  Here&#8217;s a bit of the data on me in case you are interesting in what the dashboard looks like.  </p>
<p><img src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ak-fitbit.png" alt="ak-fitbit" width="780" height="822" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9611" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ak-fitbit.png 780w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ak-fitbit-284x300.png 284w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p>I will tell you that night of sleep that I&#8217;m showing you in the picture&#8230;I was not just dragging the next day, I was downright grumpy.</p>
<p>For the record, Fitbit didn&#8217;t pay for any of this, we bought it ourselves. ðŸ™‚</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m the type of person that has to constantly change up my workout routine because, well lets be honest, I get BORED! Some of the workouts I tried and loved in 2010 include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bootcamp; by far my favorite workout of the year because everyday is something different!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NFNFMQ/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">No More Trouble Zones</a>; this was a good &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel like going to the gym&#8221; workout.</li>
<li>Reformer Pilates; Not a huge cardio workout, but GREAT for strength training.</li>
<li>Bickram Yoga; I only did this a couple of times because it was so dang TOUGH, but I think this should be my go to in 2011 to help sweat off the baby weight.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, I put a question mark next to the title of this post because I&#8217;m interested to see if there&#8217;s a new workout that I need to know about and/or try!?!?!? It seems that every year there&#8217;s a huge fad, and I&#8217;m not above jumping on a bandwagon&#8230;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Soooooo, an introductory, I have been working on my <a title="Couch to 5k" href="http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml" target="_blank">C25K</a> thing.Â  I got turned on to this program from an older post over at <a title="Whoorl" href="http://whoorl.com/archives/435" target="_blank">Whoorl</a>.Â  Apparently it is/was this thing that helps you go from not.running.an.inch to be being able to run a 5k or even more.Â  I think I missed the boat when it was a HUGE DEAL, but am loving it nonetheless.Â  Melis and I actually have signed up for a 5k coming up here soon because of our excitement with the program.</p>
<p>Back to where I was headed&#8230;.Aus comes home with a funrun sign up sheet.Â  &#8220;Mommy will you run with me&#8221;.Â  Me:Â  HELLZ yes.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6048" title="cr-fun run" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/cr-fun-run.png" alt="" width="500" height="335" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/cr-fun-run.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/cr-fun-run-300x201.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>A couple of things noteworthy about said &#8220;funrun&#8221;:</p>
<p>1.Â  Parents took the fun out of funrun &#8211; they were there for blood.Â  I ran the entire time (a whopping mile), didn&#8217;t die and had a decent time.Â  There were parents there ready to be beat the shit out of me to get to the finish line.Â  Not something I was prepared for.</p>
<p>2.Â  Kids took the run out of funrun &#8211; shouldn&#8217;t funrun mean you at least attempt to run?Â  Apparently not.Â  I don&#8217;t think any elaboration is needed on that one.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we had a great time, Ben was a really good cheerleader (HAHA) and it was good mommy/son bonding.</p>
<p>Sidenote: thats Aus&#8217; runners face!</p>

	<p>Soooooo, an introductory, I have been working on my <a title="Couch to 5k" href="http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml" target="_blank">C25K</a> thing.Â  I got turned on to this program from an older post over at <a title="Whoorl" href="http://whoorl.com/archives/435" target="_blank">Whoorl</a>.Â  Apparently it is/was this thing that helps you go from not.running.an.inch to be being able to run a 5k or even more.Â  I think I missed the boat when it was a HUGE DEAL, but am loving it nonetheless.Â  Melis and I actually have signed up for a 5k coming up here soon because of our excitement with the program.</p>
<p>Back to where I was headed&#8230;.Aus comes home with a funrun sign up sheet.Â  &#8220;Mommy will you run with me&#8221;.Â  Me:Â  HELLZ yes.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6048" title="cr-fun run" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/cr-fun-run.png" alt="" width="500" height="335" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/cr-fun-run.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/cr-fun-run-300x201.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>A couple of things noteworthy about said &#8220;funrun&#8221;:</p>
<p>1.Â  Parents took the fun out of funrun &#8211; they were there for blood.Â  I ran the entire time (a whopping mile), didn&#8217;t die and had a decent time.Â  There were parents there ready to be beat the shit out of me to get to the finish line.Â  Not something I was prepared for.</p>
<p>2.Â  Kids took the run out of funrun &#8211; shouldn&#8217;t funrun mean you at least attempt to run?Â  Apparently not.Â  I don&#8217;t think any elaboration is needed on that one.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we had a great time, Ben was a really good cheerleader (HAHA) and it was good mommy/son bonding.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>So me and my Tipsy Girl <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/court/" target="_blank">Court</a> have been on a work out kick for the past 8 or 9 weeks. We joined our local <a href="http://www.ymca.net/" target="_blank">YMCA</a>Â and have been doing everything from spinning to boot camp, to basic cardio and weights. The main thing that we&#8217;ve taken away from our workouts is a) it&#8217;s nice to have a friend that keeps you honest and makes you go to workout, even when you don&#8217;t want to and b) the Y has given us an outlet for our ADD selves so we don&#8217;t get bored.</p>
<p><a href="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sk-workout-clothes.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2895" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sk-workout-clothes.png" alt="" width="500" height="495" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sk-workout-clothes.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sk-workout-clothes-150x150.png 150w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sk-workout-clothes-300x297.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>These are some of my workout basics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nike, <a href="http://niketown.nike.com/niketown/catalog/category.jsp?l=shop,pwp,c-1+100701/f-+10001+12001/hf-/t-ONESTORE/pn-1/ipp-48" target="_blank">Shox Turbo</a>: I&#8217;m a huge fan of this shoe. I got my first pair of shox two years ago and I think those need to be replaced with these awesome green ones!</li>
<li>Academy, <a href="http://www.academy.com/index.php?page=content&amp;target=products/apparel/womens/athletic/tanks&amp;start=0&amp;selectedSKU=WEB+0704-01681-0197" target="_blank">Soffe Cotton Rib Tank</a>: These are $6.99, need I say more?</li>
<li>Academy, <a href="http://www.academy.com/index.php?page=content&amp;target=products/apparel/womens/athletic/bras&amp;start=0&amp;selectedSKU=WEB+0775-04080-1157" target="_blank">BCG Razorback Bra</a>: Just to keep the girls in line.</li>
<li>Academy, <a href="http://www.academy.com/index.php?page=content&amp;target=products/apparel/womens/athletic/pants&amp;start=0&amp;selectedSKU=WEB+0714-02080-4520" target="_blank">Nike Field Pants</a>: I typically do NOT work out in pants because I don&#8217;t like to sweat and I feel like they always make me sweat more (I know, I know, I&#8217;m weird). These are great (only if I have to) workout pants because they are not tight (I&#8217;m a bit booty girl and those cute yoga tights do nothing for me).</li>
<li>Academy, <a href="http://www.academy.com/index.php?page=content&amp;target=products/apparel/womens/athletic/shorts&amp;start=16&amp;selectedSKU=WEB+0707-02080-1646" target="_blank">Nike Tempo Shorts</a>: You know that embarrassing sweaty ass mark, aka SWASS, (I&#8217;m just being honest) you get when you&#8217;re really working hard? These shorts DO NOT show that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ðŸ™‚</li>
<li>Academy, <a href="http://www.academy.com/index.php?page=content&amp;target=products/apparel/womens/athletic/tops&amp;start=8&amp;selectedSKU=WEB+0701-02080-6097" target="_blank">Nike Dri-Fit T-shirt</a>: Similar to the shorts, this shirt doesn&#8217;t show sweat marks so people can go on believing that us girls don&#8217;t sweat like pigs&#8230;OH, and this shirt keeps you nice and toasty when the weather is less than optimal outside.</li>
