			<div class="entry-content"><p>So, I have naturally<del> janky</del>wavy hair, but for the VAST majority of my life I have always worn my hair straight. Partly because I didn&#8217;t 100% know how to fix my hair when it was wavy, and partly because I had the time to spend on my hair so it didn&#8217;t really matter. BOY HOW THINGS CHANGE!</p>
<p>After C was born I learned right quick how to make my wavy hair look less janky and more CUTE&#8230;here are a couple of the products I use:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001ALQBAG/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Redken Fresh Curls Curl Booster</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002RT72BM/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Redken Glass</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I spritz my wet hair w/ the curl booster and crinkle my hair up all over. I then use aÂ diffuser to dry my hair. After that, I use a 1 inch curling iron to fix the janky parts of my hair, rub a small amount of redken glass through my hair, spray with hair spray, and voila! This process takes all of less than 10 minutes from start to finish (versus the 30+ minutes it takes me to straighten it from shower to door)&#8230;WOOHOO! Not too shabby eh?</p>

<p><strong>1. What did you do in 2011 that youâd never done before?</strong></p>
<p>Entered and completed a 10k and lived to write about it.Â  HAHAA.</p>
<p><strong>2. Did you keep your new yearâs resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</strong></p>
<p>I would say that I didn&#8217;t technically meet my resolution of losing the amount of weight that I wanted, but IÂ am pumped for the new year.</p>
<p><strong>3. Did anyone close to you give birth? </strong></p>
<p>OMG did they ever.Â  Sarah and AK both in one year.Â  It&#8217;s been a lot of baby talk round these parts.</p>
<p><strong>4. Did anyone close to you die?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I had a cousin pass in July.Â  Very sad situation that really rattled my family.Â  Unfortunately my Aunt also died just last month while in the hospital under going heart surgery.Â  You just have to buckle down as a family and push through the good and the bad.Â  There was more bad this year than I would have liked.</p>
<p><strong>5. What countries did you visit?</strong></p>
<p>JAMAICA BABY.Â  Ben&#8217;s sis got married in Montego Bay and we were able to have a really badass vacation there in turn.Â  Snorkling was my favorite activity there.</p>
<p><strong>6. What would you like to have in 2012 that you didnât have in 2011?</strong></p>
<p>A siamese cat that magically gets over his little man, I hate every other cat in the house so I am going to piss in a pile of clothes act.</p>
<p><strong>7. What dates from 2011 will be etched upon your memory, and why?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately my cousins death on July 27, 2011.Â  We were very close for a number of years and again, just took the whole thing pretty hard.Â  It was a very senseless situation.</p>
<p>I hate that the one thing that sticks out in my mind is a really bad event, but its what I think of first.</p>
<p><strong>8. What was your biggest achievement of this year?</strong></p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t entirely complete because the school is not over, but&#8230;.volunteering to be and acting as homeroom mom.Â  With that comes organization of all class parties and field day.Â  It&#8217;s also given me more time with Austin at a time when he is really starting to naturally become more independent. Â  So far is been a lot of fun and I&#8217;ve been able to be front row for all of Austin&#8217;s activities at school.</p>
<p><strong>9. What was your biggest failure?</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have anything that I look back and said that I completely failed on.Â  There are times I have acted in ways that I shouldn&#8217;t have though.</p>
<p><strong>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</strong></p>
<p>If sick is being defined as an illness or injury that actually had you down,Â  I do not believe I was sick one single time in 2011.Â  Tipsy ladies, feel free to correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p><strong>11. What was the best thing you bought?</strong></p>
<p>A new TV for our bedroom.Â  I had thought before that I really didn&#8217;t care about TVs, until I got a nice upgraded one to watch my Law and Orders on.</p>
<p><strong>12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</strong></p>
<p>Ben was great with all the deaths and goings on this year.Â  You know simple things like just sitting with someone at the hospital or in a funeral service make the world of difference.Â  You know that you have someone there that is giving you 100% of their support.</p>
<p>Another person that has totally blown me away is my dear friend Der.Â  Its been pretty amazing watching her take a natural gift and be able to turn into a career that makes everyone of her customers so happy.Â  Shes truly got something good going there.</p>
<p><strong>13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?</strong></p>
<p>Blah.</p>
<p><strong>14. Where did most your money go? </strong></p>
<p>Its honestly felt like Austin ate, literally ate in food, my paycheck.Â  What little was left went to Austin&#8217;s first football season.Â  What a great experience and GREAT people watching.Â  Soccer was nothing compared to these characters.</p>
<p><strong>15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?</strong></p>
<p>I did/am totally wrapped up in the excitement of watching my best friends with their babies.Â  Its been a lot of fun to see all tha&#8217; boys and its also fun that we are all boy moms now, some of us for the second time.Â  Its a very special club.</p>
<p><strong>16. What song will always remind you of 2011?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;What Sarah Said&#8221; by Death Cab for Cutie</p>
<p><strong>17.</strong> <strong>Compared to this time last year, are you: a) happier or sadder? b) thinner or fatter? c) richer or poorer?</strong></p>
<p>Happier still.Â  It&#8217;s still been a fun year and I have the best people in my life.</p>
<p>Actually if you get down to technicalities, I am thinner&#8211;but not by much!</p>
<p>Same.</p>
<p><strong>18. What do you wish youâd done more of?</strong></p>
<p>Traveling.Â  Its so nice to get out and see new places and experience new things.Â  I want to do more of that in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>19. What do you wish youâd done less of?</strong></p>
<p>Worrying about things I can&#8217;t change.</p>
<p><strong>20. How did you spend Christmas?</strong></p>
<p>In Houston with my family and Ben&#8217;s family.Â  Christmas Eve is at my parents place with all of my Mom&#8217;s side of the family.Â  Its a fun and extremely loud and obnoxious gathering.Â  One of my Aunts threatened to &#8220;slap the shit&#8221; out of another one of my Aunts this year, so that&#8217;s always a good laugh.</p>
<p><strong>21. Did you fall in love with 2011?</strong></p>
<p>I think in any relationship you continue to get closer and closer when its going good.Â  So I would definitely say with Ben.Â  CHEESE BALL!</p>
<p><strong>22. What was your favorite TV program?</strong></p>
<p>DUDE&#8230;.I seriously have an issue.Â  All I watch is Law and Order on DVDs.Â  Now that I have been through all of the Law and Order: SVUs,Â  I have moved on to the orignal Law and Orders.Â  I am seriously an addict.</p>
<p><strong>23. Do you hate anyone now that you didnât hate this time last year?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>24. What was the best book you read?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely fell head over heels for the Hunger Games Trilogy.</p>
<p><strong>25. What was your greatest musical discovery?</strong></p>
<p>Sarah Jaffe.Â Actually Ben discovered her for me and took me to a concert.Â  She&#8217;s amazing and a REALLY chill.</p>
<p><strong>26. What did you want and get?</strong></p>
<p>You know I decided to look for a job in January of 2011 and in less than a month I landed a job that I absolutely love.Â  I think that was my best catch this year.</p>
<p><strong>27. What did you want and not get?</strong></p>
<p>Nothing I can even think of.</p>
<p><strong>28. What was your favorite film of 2010?</strong></p>
<p>I am going to go with&#8230;.Limitless.Â  It had me tuned in from the second it started.</p>
<p><strong>29. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</strong></p>
<p>On my 31st birthday Ben took me to a concert and then surprised me with a bunch of my friends that were already at a bar waiting for me to ring in the big 3-1.Â  I really felt like it was &#8220;my day&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>30. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</strong></p>
<p>I think a TAD more organization would have helped.Â  I don&#8217; think I am in immense need, butÂ I started off the new year by organizaing all of my jewelry.Â  My next battle is my closet.Â  So I have high hopes to get more organized. ð</p>
<p><strong>31. How would you describe your personal fashion concept of 2010?</strong></p>
<p>Patterns and bangles.Â  I did a lot of thrift shopping this year as well.</p>
<p><strong>32. What kept you sane?</strong></p>
<p>The good and bad and up and downs of raising and being as involved as I can with Austin.Â  Its been work for Ben and I together as well.Â  Its definitely a learning process that never stops.</p>
<p><strong>33. What political issue stirred you the most?</strong></p>
<p>When that TV reporter had some type of seizure or something and was talking all crazy.Â  That stirred me real good.Â  Google it.Â  Thank me later.</p>
<p><strong>34. Who did you miss?</strong></p>
<p>I miss working my old co-workers, they were a really fun crew.Â  They have all also moved on to other jobs since then as well.Â  Its just so important to have people that make you laugh, you can talk to and rely on at work.Â  I spend more time at work than anywhere else, so that kind of thing is important to me.</p>
<p><strong>35. Who was the best new person you met?</strong></p>
<p>On Austin&#8217;s football team there are twin boys (age 10) that we have gotten to know during this year.Â  I have to say they are so damn cool and have a way of making you look at things in a totally different perspective.Â  They have two of the sweetest personalities and couldn&#8217;t have a better outlook on things, considering that haven&#8217;t had the best home life.</p>
<p><strong>36. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2011.</strong></p>
<p>That you really should try to make the best of each relationship, day, conversation.</p>
<p><strong>37. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year.</strong></p>
<p><em>Love is watching someone die.â Death Cab for Cutie</em></p>

<p>Beer Can Shandies<br />
6 (12oz) cans of your favorite beer<br />
1 (16oz) carton of lemonade</p>
<p>Open a can of lager and drink four sips.  Top remaining beer with lemonade.  Swirl to combine, adding more lemonade as desired.</p>

			<div class="entry-content"><p>Hey y&#8217;all! Sorry for the lack of posting! It&#8217;s been a bit nutty around here, hopefully we can get back into a groove here. Â I thought I&#8217;d share some new hair stuff I just recently tried. Just to give you an idea&#8230;I have the thickest hair known to man and live in a VERY humid area, so not only does it take me like 500 years to dry my hair straight, then I have to fight the frizz when I walk outside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JDPS7I/?tag=weea-20">KMS California Free Shape</a>-So I&#8217;ve used this twice now and I&#8217;m pretty sure it reduced my drying time considerably, but I did have a certain 5 month old screaming off and on during the drying process, so I&#8217;ll keep you posted on this one.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.asp?pid=226210&#038;catid=157879&#038;aid=335949&#038;aparam=QFGLnEolOWg-zSAgRHaa3xtf_9VWQYlgEQ">Blow Weather Girl Climate Neutralizing Complex</a>-This has definitely worked the two times I have used it. I have not had frizz problems as of late.  However I&#8217;d love to try this in the summer when it&#8217;s super duper humid and hot to see how it does.</p>
<p>Have y&#8217;all tried anything lately that you think is the bomb? Care to share?</p>

<div class="post-info"><span class="date published time" title="2011-09-29T17:41:24+00:00">September 29, 2011</span>  by <span class="author vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="../../../../author/jwo/index.html" rel="author">jwo</a></span></span>  </div><div class="entry-content"><p>Hi Again! I&#8217;m JWo, AK&#8217;s husband, posting this Iron Chef recipe from Cafe Beignet in New Orleans. I know right? Very meta. Also: your jealousy &#8212; I can feel it.</p>
<p>If this is your first Iron Chef post (it&#8217;s my second, so don&#8217;t feel too out of it), Danielle from elleinadspir created an idea that her husband would name an ingredient each week. Then, we cook with it! Last week was Balsamic Vinegar (<a href="../../../../2011/09/iron-chef-balsamic-strawberry-ice-cream/index.html">my recipe,</a> <a href="http://www.elleinadspir.com/2011/09/yorn-desh-born-der-ritt-de-gitt-der-gue.html">Danielle&#8217;s linkup</a>). This week: <a href="http://www.elleinadspir.com/2011/09/bring-us-pitcher-of-beer-every-seven.html">BEER</a>.</p>
<p>Now, my wife&#8230; she does not like the beer. She&#8217;s more a marg type of girl. So I had to sneak this secret ingredient in &#8212; how would someone do such a thing? By hiding the beer in a slow cooker OF COURSE. The best part? She loved these tacos, even after hearing it was beer&#8217;d.</p>
<p>I call this thing: BBBBQ Pork. the extra B is for beer. The other extra B is a typo</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>* 1 lb pork tenderloin (BBQ seasoning if you can find)<br />
* 1 Onion<br />
* 1 Shiner Bock (or other dark beer)<br />
* 1 Can rotel (tomatoes and green chiles)<br />
* 1 Can Pinto Beans</p>
<h3>Method</h3>
<p>* Slice onion, layer into slow cooker<br />
* Add pork tenderloin on top of onions<br />
* Add 2/3 of the beer. Reserve other 1/3 for another use<br />
* pour rotel over tenderloin<br />
* Heat on high for 4 hours (or low for all the day)</p>
<p>On to the Pics!</p>
