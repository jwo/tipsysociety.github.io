		<description><![CDATA[<p>In Texas big hair is where it&#8217;s at, yáll. I was not blessed with luscious thick locks that naturally plump up the way every Texas girl dreams. My super duper fine hair lays like a limp noodle on my head unless I do a lot, I mean A LOT, of jerseylicious style teasing. Enter hair styling powder. I was first introduced to this in the form of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001CN5S4C/?tag=weea-20+powder"> Osis Dust It</a> and while I love this product it&#8217;s a little steep for my taste as far as price goes for such a tiny container. Low and  behold I have found an almost identical product for under $5!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00546F4CY/?tag=weea-20+styling+powder"> Got2B Volumizing Styling Powder</a> is the BEST! It gives the same effect of the much more expensive powder for a fraction of the cost. I can sprinkle a little of this at my roots and massage or tease it in a little and voila!</p>

Has anybody used this as a dry shampoo AND to cover greys? I just read that <a href="http://www.realstylenetwork.com/blogs/beauty/2013/01/jillian-harris-5-favourite-beauty-products/">Jillian Harris</a> of The Bachelorette fame uses it for that very reason and I think I could get on board with that to prolong my color. But would love to know if anybody else out there uses it and what they think&#8230;.<br />

Have yall heard of this line of hair products that Jennifer Aniston started using and loved it so much that she is now a co-owner and <a href="http://www.livingproof.com/jen">face of the brand</a>? So obvs that caught my eye because Jennifer Aniston is like my personal hair idol.  I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve taken a picture of her to the salon asking for whatever cut or color she&#8217;s got going on. A ton of times I tell ya&#8230;So anyway, when I heard she was connected to a line of products I for sure wanted to try it out.  Amazon has a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0042DHKGS/?tag=weea-20+proof+frizz">set of the products</a> in sample sizes and that&#8217;s what I started with.  My kit included shampoo, conditioner, straightening cream and a curling cream.  I already used the shampoo and conditioner all up and while I loved it, what I think changed my hair the most has been the Straight Making Styling Cream. Not only does it make my hair straight and smooth but it also helps with the same in both second and third day hair. My hair is very thick and a &#8220;not pretty, wavy&#8221; if I let it air dry.  So I pretty much hate the blow dry process, it takes FOREVER. This doesn&#8217;t change that fact but what it does help with is extending my style for longer.  Love it!<br />

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I thought I&#8217;d share some stuff I&#8217;ve used in the last few months either via a sample or I&#8217;ve purchased and been using, that I&#8217;ve fallen in love with.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004G37P28/?tag=weea-20">Biodroga Intense Moisture Formula Eye Care</a>-I have been on the hunt for an eye cream for what seems like EVER. The problem I run into is that as the day goes by my eyes start burning from certain eye creams. I got a sample of this a while back and used it for a good week without any problems&#8230;that was a first! So I bit the bullet and bought it and I have no clue if it&#8217;s going to make me look 20 years younger but I figure eye cream that doesn&#8217;t cause massive burning is better than no eye cream at all. Right?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0015FSH86/?tag=weea-20">Aquage Beyond Shine Spray</a>-I use this when I&#8217;m done with my hair, but I spray it in my hand first and then run my hands through my hair.  If I spray it directly on my hair it will look DUUUURTEEEEE and I might as well start all over.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P281401&amp;shouldPaginate=true&amp;categoryId=3976#">Nars Pro-Prime Pore Refining Primer &#8211; Oil-Free</a>-I read somewhere that as you get older you will want to use a primer under your foundation so that it falls into all those fine lines and wrinkles and your foundation will go on smoother.  I&#8217;ve tried a couple and then got this as a sample from Sephora and LOVED it. I feel like it makes my pores noticeably smaller and my foundation goes on smooth but also I&#8217;m not an oil slick by the end of the day.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.redken.com/products/styling/heat-styling/hot-sets-22">Redken Hot Sets 22 Thermal Setting Mist</a>-I use this prior to flat ironing my hair.  I like it. I mean there are a lot of different ones out there and I just thought I&#8217;d change it up a bit.  Good stuff.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P266126&amp;om_mmc=aff-linkshare-null-J84DHJLQkR4&amp;_requestid=6769#">Rosebud Salve in a Tube</a>-I&#8217;m a fan of the Rosebud Salve in the little tin, so when I saw this (and I may be behind the times on this being in a tube) I instantly bought it.  It&#8217;s always nice to change up the lip balm every now and then and I love the way this smells.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.folica.com/hair-care/hair-oils-and-serums/jonathan-weightless-smooth-no-frizz-hydrating-balm">Jonathan Product Weightless Smooth No-Frizz Hydrating Balm</a>-I&#8217;m going to venture to say that this product has been LIFE CHANGING. And I&#8217;m two for two on<a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2011/05/hair-dirt/"> Jonathan Product</a> stuff. I think I&#8217;ve said this before but my hair is very thick and naturally wavy but not always in a good way, so I straighten my hair when I want to look presentable.  However, living in the Houston area with humidity 11 out of 12 months of the year, straightening my hair can be challenging.  UNTIL NOW! I got this stuff as a sample and I just thought I&#8217;d give it a shot and OMG the difference it has made in getting my hair straight and KEEPING it straight once I walk outside is unbelievable.  It&#8217;s a keeper.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002UL10HY/?tag=weea-20">Finishing and Blending Face Antibacterial Makeup Brush #955 &#8211; Studio Line by bdellium tools</a>-I&#8217;ve always been the kinda girl that put on her foundation with a sponge, and thought I might try a brush recently and this one didn&#8217;t disappoint.  It&#8217;s kinda crazy how different foundation can look with a brush as opposed to a sponge.  Definitely worth a shot.</li>

	<p>I thought I&#8217;d share some stuff I&#8217;ve used in the last few months either via a sample or I&#8217;ve purchased and been using, that I&#8217;ve fallen in love with.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004G37P28/?tag=weea-20">Biodroga Intense Moisture Formula Eye Care</a>-I have been on the hunt for an eye cream for what seems like EVER. The problem I run into is that as the day goes by my eyes start burning from certain eye creams. I got a sample of this a while back and used it for a good week without any problems&#8230;that was a first! So I bit the bullet and bought it and I have no clue if it&#8217;s going to make me look 20 years younger but I figure eye cream that doesn&#8217;t cause massive burning is better than no eye cream at all. Right?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0015FSH86/?tag=weea-20">Aquage Beyond Shine Spray</a>-I use this when I&#8217;m done with my hair, but I spray it in my hand first and then run my hands through my hair.  If I spray it directly on my hair it will look DUUUURTEEEEE and I might as well start all over.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P281401&amp;shouldPaginate=true&amp;categoryId=3976#">Nars Pro-Prime Pore Refining Primer &#8211; Oil-Free</a>-I read somewhere that as you get older you will want to use a primer under your foundation so that it falls into all those fine lines and wrinkles and your foundation will go on smoother.  I&#8217;ve tried a couple and then got this as a sample from Sephora and LOVED it. I feel like it makes my pores noticeably smaller and my foundation goes on smooth but also I&#8217;m not an oil slick by the end of the day.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.redken.com/products/styling/heat-styling/hot-sets-22">Redken Hot Sets 22 Thermal Setting Mist</a>-I use this prior to flat ironing my hair.  I like it. I mean there are a lot of different ones out there and I just thought I&#8217;d change it up a bit.  Good stuff.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P266126&amp;om_mmc=aff-linkshare-null-J84DHJLQkR4&amp;_requestid=6769#">Rosebud Salve in a Tube</a>-I&#8217;m a fan of the Rosebud Salve in the little tin, so when I saw this (and I may be behind the times on this being in a tube) I instantly bought it.  It&#8217;s always nice to change up the lip balm every now and then and I love the way this smells.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.folica.com/hair-care/hair-oils-and-serums/jonathan-weightless-smooth-no-frizz-hydrating-balm">Jonathan Product Weightless Smooth No-Frizz Hydrating Balm</a>-I&#8217;m going to venture to say that this product has been LIFE CHANGING. And I&#8217;m two for two on<a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2011/05/hair-dirt/"> Jonathan Product</a> stuff.

		<description><![CDATA[<p>So, I have naturally<del> janky</del>wavy hair, but for the VAST majority of my life I have always worn my hair straight. Partly because I didn&#8217;t 100% know how to fix my hair when it was wavy, and partly because I had the time to spend on my hair so it didn&#8217;t really matter. BOY HOW THINGS CHANGE!</p>
<p>After C was born I learned right quick how to make my wavy hair look less janky and more CUTE&#8230;here are a couple of the products I use:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001ALQBAG/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Redken Fresh Curls Curl Booster</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002RT72BM/?tag=weea-20" target="_blank">Redken Glass</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I spritz my wet hair w/ the curl booster and crinkle my hair up all over. I then use a diffuser to dry my hair. After that, I use a 1 inch curling iron to fix the janky parts of my hair, rub a small amount of redken glass through my hair, spray with hair spray, and voila! This process takes all of less than 10 minutes from start to finish (versus the 30+ minutes it takes me to straighten it from shower to door)&#8230;WOOHOO! Not too shabby eh?</p>
<p><a href="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/momandme-e1326893695203.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9292" title="momandme" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/momandme-e1326893695203.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="334" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh yeah, my fellow Tipsy gal <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/der/" target="_blank">Der</a> took this pic. She has COMPLETELY found her calling in life ya&#8217;ll!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Hey y&#8217;all! Sorry for the lack of posting! It&#8217;s been a bit nutty around here, hopefully we can get back into a groove here.  I thought I&#8217;d share some new hair stuff I just recently tried. Just to give you an idea&#8230;I have the thickest hair known to man and live in a VERY humid area, so not only does it take me like 500 years to dry my hair straight, then I have to fight the frizz when I walk outside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JDPS7I/?tag=weea-20">KMS California Free Shape</a>-So I&#8217;ve used this twice now and I&#8217;m pretty sure it reduced my drying time considerably, but I did have a certain 5 month old screaming off and on during the drying process, so I&#8217;ll keep you posted on this one.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.asp?pid=226210&#038;catid=157879&#038;aid=335949&#038;aparam=QFGLnEolOWg-zSAgRHaa3xtf_9VWQYlgEQ">Blow Weather Girl Climate Neutralizing Complex</a>-This has definitely worked the two times I have used it. I have not had frizz problems as of late.  However I&#8217;d love to try this in the summer when it&#8217;s super duper humid and hot to see how it does.</p>
<p>Have y&#8217;all tried anything lately that you think is the bomb? Care to share?</p>

I have very thick, wavy hair that I flat iron when I like to look presentable.  So my hair definitely takes a beating.  But this stuff really makes my hair super duper soft, smooth and healthier feeling.  You should definitely give it a try if you are in need of some hair repair.</p>
