		<description><![CDATA[<p>Have you heard of <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/home">Fitbit</a>? It&#8217;s sorta like a pedometer in that it tracks your steps, but it does so much more than that.  My husband ordered Fitbits back in December for us. You wear the little tracker during the day as well as at night and it will track your steps, stairs climbed, calories, weight, and sleep.  There is an iPhone app that it works with where you can enter the food you eat throughout the day.  In addition they have a scale that syncs up with everything so you know your BMI.  You can set up weight loss goals and it will tell you what your calories should be for the day to lose weight by a certain period of time. You can also add how many glasses of water you&#8217;ve had.  </p>
<p>The MOST interesting aspect for me is how it tracks sleep. After having used the Fitbit for the last few months I have determined if I am awakened anytime between 12a and 2a I will definitely be dragging the next day.  If I somehow manage to not be awakened during that time I seem to be fine.  It&#8217;s quite interesting.  Here&#8217;s a bit of the data on me in case you are interesting in what the dashboard looks like.  </p>

<p>I will tell you that night of sleep that I&#8217;m showing you in the picture&#8230;I was not just dragging the next day, I was downright grumpy.</p>
<p>For the record, Fitbit didn&#8217;t pay for any of this, we bought it ourselves. ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>Back to where I was headed&#8230;.Aus comes home with a funrun sign up sheet.Â  &#8220;Mommy will you run with me&#8221;.Â  Me:Â  HELLZ yes.</p>

<p>A couple of things noteworthy about said &#8220;funrun&#8221;:</p>
<p>1.Â  Parents took the fun out of funrun &#8211; they were there for blood.Â  I ran the entire time (a whopping mile), didn&#8217;t die and had a decent time.Â  There were parents there ready to be beat the shit out of me to get to the finish line.Â  Not something I was prepared for.</p>
<p>2.Â  Kids took the run out of funrun &#8211; shouldn&#8217;t funrun mean you at least attempt to run?Â  Apparently not.Â  I don&#8217;t think any elaboration is needed on that one.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we had a great time, Ben was a really good cheerleader (HAHA) and it was good mommy/son bonding.</p>
<p>Sidenote: thats Aus&#8217; runners face!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve talked <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/04/iphone-apps-livestrong/">before</a> about how my husband and I use a <a href="http://zenofitness.com/">trainer</a>. My husband and I used to workout together and then I got all preggo and we had to split up our workouts because I had to take it down a few notches on the workout front.Â  Since our kiddo was born we&#8217;ve still kept our workouts separate and since then Zeno has moved to a different gym and we followed him. Because we LOVE HIM! He&#8217;s really not the drill sargeant type at all&#8230;he listens, he knows when you can do more and he knows when you are DONE.Â  And because Zeno loves us, he&#8217;s decided to give one lucky Tipsy reader 2 free personal training sessions.</p>
<p>So if you are in the Houston area and you want to win two free sessions with Zeno or you are <em>going to be</em> in the Houston area sometime soon and want to win two free sessions with Zeno leave a comment letting us know what you hate most about working out.</p>
<p>The Rules<em><em></em></em></p>
<p><em><em>One entry per person. </em><em>No entries after 5:00 pm Central Time Friday.Â  Winners will be randomly selected from among entrants. </em><em>Winners will be announced at 9:00 am Central Time Monday.</em></em><br />
<strong>Congratulations Kenny!Â  You are the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">next victim for Zeno</span> WINNER!Â  We&#8217;ll be emailing you with Zeno&#8217;s info so you can go get your sweat on!Â  Thanks to everyone for entering.<br />

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The other day I was looking for some sort of calorie tracker app because <a href="http://zenofitness.com/">my trainer</a> was asking me to provide him with a food diary of my week.Â  Because I&#8217;m lazy and all and don&#8217;t want to write all that crap out with a pen/paper I thought it would be easy to use my handy dandy iPhone.Â  I hit the jackpot with the <a href="http://www.livestrong.com/thedailyplate/">Livestrong app</a>.Â  I entered my basic height/weight info and it guided me towards what my daily calories should be.Â  Upon entering the food I ate throughout the day I found that it had almost everything I ate in its little search engine including the specific HEB cheese slices I put in my pita sandwich at lunch.Â  On the days I workout I can enter in my activity for calories burned.Â  After my week of food diary-ing was up, I logged into my Livestrong account online and could print out my food diary and hand it over to my trainer.Â  Upon review he told me he could see a few problems right off the bat&#8230;hmmm wonder if it was those chewy Sweetarts from last Sunday.Â  Damn you leftover Easter candy!Â  I&#8217;m definitely going to make some adjustments and keep going with the app, it&#8217;s sort of addicting!</p>
<p>As a side note, when searching for exercise activities, while it does have a plethora of activities to choose from &#8220;Running after 18 month old child&#8221; was not an option.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>So me and my Tipsy Girl <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/court/" target="_blank">Court</a> have been on a work out kick for the past 8 or 9 weeks. We joined our local <a href="http://www.ymca.net/" target="_blank">YMCA</a>Â and have been doing everything from spinning to boot camp, to basic cardio and weights. The main thing that we&#8217;ve taken away from our workouts is a) it&#8217;s nice to have a friend that keeps you honest and makes you go to workout, even when you don&#8217;t want to and b) the Y has given us an outlet for our ADD selves so we don&#8217;t get bored.</p>
<p><a href="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sk-workout-clothes.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2895" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sk-workout-clothes.png" alt="" width="500" height="495" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sk-workout-clothes.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sk-workout-clothes-150x150.png 150w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/sk-workout-clothes-300x297.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>These are some of my workout basics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nike, <a href="http://niketown.nike.com/niketown/catalog/category.jsp?l=shop,pwp,c-1+100701/f-+10001+12001/hf-/t-ONESTORE/pn-1/ipp-48" target="_blank">Shox Turbo</a>: I&#8217;m a huge fan of this shoe. I got my first pair of shox two years ago and I think those need to be replaced with these awesome green ones!</li>
<li>Academy, <a href="http://www.academy.com/index.php?page=content&amp;target=products/apparel/womens/athletic/tanks&amp;start=0&amp;selectedSKU=WEB+0704-01681-0197" target="_blank">Soffe Cotton Rib Tank</a>: These are $6.99, need I say more?</li>
<li>Academy, <a href="http://www.academy.com/index.php?page=content&amp;target=products/apparel/womens/athletic/bras&amp;start=0&amp;selectedSKU=WEB+0775-04080-1157" target="_blank">BCG Razorback Bra</a>: Just to keep the girls in line.</li>
<li>Academy, <a href="http://www.academy.com/index.php?page=content&amp;target=products/apparel/womens/athletic/pants&amp;start=0&amp;selectedSKU=WEB+0714-02080-4520" target="_blank">Nike Field Pants</a>: I typically do NOT work out in pants because I don&#8217;t like to sweat and I feel like they always make me sweat more (I know, I know, I&#8217;m weird). These are great (only if I have to) workout pants because they are not tight (I&#8217;m a bit booty girl and those cute yoga tights do nothing for me).</li>
<li>Academy, <a href="http://www.academy.com/index.php?page=content&amp;target=products/apparel/womens/athletic/shorts&amp;start=16&amp;selectedSKU=WEB+0707-02080-1646" target="_blank">Nike Tempo Shorts</a>: You know that embarrassing sweaty ass mark, aka SWASS, (I&#8217;m just being honest) you get when you&#8217;re really working hard? These shorts DO NOT show that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ðŸ™‚</li>
<li>Academy, <a href="http://www.academy.com/index.php?page=content&amp;target=products/apparel/womens/athletic/tops&amp;start=8&amp;selectedSKU=WEB+0701-02080-6097" target="_blank">Nike Dri-Fit T-shirt</a>: Similar to the shorts, this shirt doesn&#8217;t show sweat marks so people can go on believing that us girls don&#8217;t sweat like pigs&#8230;OH, and this shirt keeps you nice and toasty when the weather is less than optimal outside.</li>

	<p>Oh don&#8217;t roll your eyes over there. I get the feeling that some peeps tend to think it&#8217;s for the ladies of an older generation, butÂ Chadwick&#8217;s has some really fun and youthful pieces that I&#8217;m coveting right now.Â You don&#8217;t have to be a geriatric to rock any of these looks!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I never make New Year&#8217;s Resolutions. Ever.Â  But I thought, you know, we are going into this year a little different than any year before and I thought, why not.Â  I think it&#8217;ll be fun to look back and see if I could pull any of this off in a year.Â  So here goes:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1817" title="ak-resolutions" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/ak-resolutions.png" alt="ak-resolutions" width="500" height="768" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/ak-resolutions.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/ak-resolutions-195x300.png 195w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Try and take a <a href="http://www.zappos.com/new-balance-wr769-pink">walk</a> with the kiddo every day if weather allows.</li>
<li>Learn to sew, like for real with my new Christmas gift.Â  My ultimate goal:Â  a <a href="http://www.jellybeanquilts.com/samples.htm">baby clothes memory quilt</a>.</li>
<li>Implement some sort of regularly occurring date night that went to shit when we had our bouncing baby boy.</li>
<li>Get back into <a href="http://www.amcentertainment.com/">going to more movies</a> SOMEHOW, SOMEWAY!Â  My mom and I used to go to a movie every Sunday pre-bebe and pre-2009.Â  I need my theater watching experience por favor.</li>
<li>Organize!Â  Organize the junk drawer in the kitchen, organize the closets in the extra bedroom and finally organize my closet (trying on clothes and seeing what actually fits and doesn&#8217;t). (and just FYI that&#8217;s not my closet, you don&#8217;t want to see it)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Read more</a> and when I say more, like maybe a whole book.Â  Magazines don&#8217;t count.Â  Google Reader doesn&#8217;t count.Â  I may even go so far as to go for 10 books in 2010.</li>
