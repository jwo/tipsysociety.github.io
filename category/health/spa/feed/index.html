<p>For you lucky readers residing in Houston, Texas,Â  Lindsay is ready to show you her skilz!Â  The Prize:Â  &#8220;The Dharma&#8221; facial, valued at $125.00.</p>

	<p>Everyone loves to get their facial on, right? Â I&#8217;ll admit, I was scared the first couple of times, but now I am in love. Â For the partially-adult-acne-prone skin I own, I am amazed how a good facial actually helps, especially an all natural Green facial.Â  You don&#8217;t have to be the all. vegan. all. the. time. type of individual to partake in a Green salon experience. In most cases, Green salons just tend to be more environmentally responsible with their product choices and therefore healthier for your skin and hair as well.</p>
