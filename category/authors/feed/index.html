I&#8217;m probably super late to this party but I was using a Revlon cheapo eyelash curler for years and at least for me it didn&#8217;t do much. I would see all over the place, CURL YOUR LASHES as part of your quick 5 minute makeup routine and I would think, man that doesn&#8217;t do anything for me. WELL. I decided to try out this one by Tarte and IT&#8217;S THE BOMB! It literally curls SO MUCH I can&#8217;t BELIZE it! It&#8217;s worth the cost, plus this one that I bought came with a little sample size mascara and I&#8217;m never one to turn down trying a new mascara.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">First of all, do not get the impression from the title of this product that I&#8217;m an ALL NIGHTER type of girl unless by that you mean my kids are not sleeping and I&#8217;m up all night in that kind of way. But I can promise you I am not wearing makeup while my kids are trying to stay up all night and suck my will to live out of me.  I originally bought this to try and set my makeup so it stays longer DURING THE DAY. I really only have time to apply my makeup first thing in the morning, so if I have dinner plans that night I don&#8217;t have time to start all over if my makeup has just melted off throughout the day. This stuff is pretty great because I can do my makeup first thing in the morning and spray a few sprays when I&#8217;m done and it really does set it for the day.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s no secret for those who know me that I wear flip flops 99% of the time.  It&#8217;s going to need to be REAL cold or REEEAL fancy to get me out of my flops. I ran into<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008BHXLW8/?tag=weea-20+flip+flops"> these</a> at my local Wally World on a random grocery trip and I am really digging them. I typically wear my Sanuk Yoga Mat flip flops, but these are just as comfortable just in a different way. These are less squishy and soft, but they have these massaging bumps in your arch that makes for happy feet as you walk around and I&#8217;m all for that.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I have been using the same make up for over 2 years (Bare Minerals) until I recently stumbled upon this little gem and I swear I will never ever go without it again in my life. It is that good. I have drank the BB cream water and it TASTES GOOD. It boasts that it primes, perfects, hydrates and corrects. My skin actually feels smoother and possibly even less blotchy after using it for a month or so now.  My favorite part is the flawless appearance it gives minus the look and feel of heavy make-up. I like looking done up, but I CAN NOT STAND the way cakey foundation feels on my face. I need light, people. Give it a try. You won&#8217;t regret it. <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2013/04/bb-beautiful/bbcream/" rel="attachment wp-att-9699"><br />

I&#8217;ve had this store favorited on Etsy for a while and I just love all the fun colors.  I&#8217;m particularly drawn to all the dainty earrings, but they also have tons of other jewelry as well.  I think these would be a perfect mother&#8217;s day gift!</p>

I&#8217;ve had this store favorited on Etsy for a while and I just love all the fun colors.  I&#8217;m particularly drawn to all the dainty earrings, but they also have tons of other jewelry as well.  I think these would be a perfect mother&#8217;s day gift!</p>

These tennis shoes are THE BOMB. Initially I had purchased these for both of my boys but then I saw that they offered them in adult sizes too and now my husband and I both wear them as well. They have arch support unlike Converse, so they are super comfy in my book.  My husband also has been wearing them a ton and says they are the most comfortable tennis shoe he has aside from his workout tennis shoes.  The boys shoes have held up very well, my oldest wears his to school everyday and just keep on truckin. The best part of these shoes? ALL OF THE COLORS. SO MANY COLORS.<br />

As yall all know we live in Texas, Houston to be specific and we just had the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo happening out here. If you aren&#8217;t familiar with that, it&#8217;s about 3 weeks of mainly big name country artists performing in our big stadium after rodeo competitions. So anyway, my point, I promise I&#8217;m getting at it&#8230;its our time to dress in our fancy cowboy boots and hit the town. Normally when you are hitting up the rodeo you can count on having to do a lot of walking so I usually wear my comfy cowboy boots, the ones I KNOW won&#8217;t be killing my feet by the end of the night. This time around when Sarah and I hit up the George Strait concert I took a chance and wore some boots that were brand spankin new. Ridiculous right? Why would I do that to myself? Well let me tell you&#8230;these boots were THE. MOST. COMFORTABLE. boots! I mean you&#8217;d have thought I had worn tennis shoes! And the color of them ain&#8217;t too shabby!</p>
