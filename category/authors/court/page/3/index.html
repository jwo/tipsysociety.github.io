<p>I have not a clue how to pronounce it.  But I do know its less that 10 dollars at most grocery stores, its crisp and clean.  If you like sparkling wines, this is a sure bet.</p>

			<div class="entry-content"><p>We thought we&#8217;d share a few pics from the baby shower we helped throw for Sarah and her hubby over the weekend.  Sarah and Kynn have decided to not find out if they are having a boy or girl ahead of time so we had to stick with a strictly gender neutral shower.  Dr. Seuss was the answer!  We couldn&#8217;t possibly get all the decor in these shots but hoooo boy was it cute!</p>
<p>We had Seuss cookies and cupcakes and Seuss themed flowers and Red Fish and Blue Fish&#8230;and the list goes on and on!  Instead of a sign in book, we had everyone sign in on a copy of &#8220;Oh, The Places You&#8217;ll Go&#8221;.  Throughout the house we used Seuss books and stuffed Seuss characters as decor.  We also played two games: Baby Animal Matchathon and Baby Price is Right.  Definitely fun games as they were both a bit challenging.  All in all I think everyone had fun and Sarah and Kynn got a ton of very cute baby stuff.  Congrats to Sarah &amp; Kynn! Can&#8217;t wait to meet the new addition!!</p>

<p><strong>1. What did you do in 2010 that you’d never done before?</strong></p>
<p>Hung off the side of the Stratosphere in Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>2. Did you keep your new year’s resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</strong></p>
<p>Yes and no.  There was nothing official.  I will for sure make more this year.</p>
<p><strong>3. Did anyone close to you give birth?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, my very best friend Der has a handsome baby boy.  Couldn&#8217;t be more excited for them.</p>
<p><strong>4. Did anyone close to you die?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>5. What countries did you visit?</strong></p>
<p>USA, kept it local.</p>
<p><strong>6. What would you like to have in 2011 that you didn’t have in 2010?</strong></p>
<p>Hard one, I am very happy with my life.  Possibly no car payment.</p>
<p><strong>7. What dates from 2010 will be etched upon your memory, and why?</strong></p>
<p>Ben and I moved in together after dating for a few years.  That was very special.  Aus made honor roll more times that I can remember.  All of those days were very special to me.  Aus had a great season in soccer and showed his drive and ambition at each game.  I was so proud.</p>
<p><strong>8. What was your biggest achievement of this year?</strong></p>
<p>Leaving a job that I had been at for a very, very long time.  Moving into a role and company that was unknown, but ultimately allowed me to be happier and be treated with respect.</p>
<p><strong>9. What was your biggest failure?</strong></p>
<p>Hmmm, I know I didn&#8217;t fail, but learning lessons of trying to be a great mom.</p>
<p><strong>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</strong></p>
<p>I actually just recently punctured myself wrapping presents.  Trip to ER, Tetanus Shot and 5 Stiches.</p>
<p><strong>11. What was the best thing you bought?</strong></p>
<p>Hard one.  iPhone?  But it was bought for me.</p>
<p><strong>12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</strong></p>
<p>Ben&#8217;s. He is so patient and loving.  I also have some great friends that I absolutely love to laugh with.</p>
<p><strong>13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?</strong></p>
<p>Meh, nobody really.  I have some great people in my life and those that weren&#8217;t aren&#8217;t in it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>14. Where did most your money go?</strong></p>
<p>Bills, standard response.</p>
<p><strong>15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?</strong></p>
<p>Sideline, Soccer Momming at Austin&#8217;s games.  I had the time of my life watching him play.</p>
<p><strong>16. What song will always remind you of 2010?</strong></p>
<p>This is hard, cause we&#8217;ve been to so many concerts.  I love Pheonix&#8217;s Love Like a Sunset.  I think that can pretty much sum it all up.</p>
<p><strong>17.</strong> <strong>Compared to this time last year, are you: a) happier or sadder? b) thinner or fatter? c) richer or poorer?</strong></p>
<p>a) Happier</p>
<p>b) MEH, about the same&#8211;still working on that one</p>
<p>c) Richer, not just money-wise.</p>
<p><strong>18. What do you wish you’d done more of?</strong></p>
<p>Relaxing, getting massages.  HAHAHA.</p>
<p><strong>19. What do you wish you’d done less of?</strong></p>
<p>Worrying</p>
<p><strong>20. How did you spend Christmas?</strong></p>
<p>At different family&#8217;s house, including mine.  Pretty low key, but busy busy!  Aus is so much fun at this age.</p>
<p><strong>21. Did you fall in love with 2010?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely.  Love Ben, Aus, my babies.</p>
<p><strong>22. What was your favorite TV program?</strong></p>
<p>Simpsons, The Office.</p>
<p><strong>23. Do you hate anyone now that you didn’t hate this time last year?</strong></p>
<p>No, definitely not.  I&#8217;m a lover, not a fighter.</p>
<p><strong>24. What was the best book you read?</strong></p>
<p>Hard Hard.  I know its bad, but I really think it was the Twilight Series for me.  I&#8217;ve never been more into a book.</p>
<p><strong>25. What was your greatest musical discovery?</strong></p>
<p>The XX.  I am absolutely obsessed.  Got to see them as ACL this year and probably listen to their album 4-5 times a week.</p>
<p><strong>26. What did you want and get?</strong></p>
<p>Great son and boyfriend and 4 cats.  Love that I have a little unit that I adore.  No present can compare to that.</p>
<p><strong>27. What did you want and not get?</strong></p>
<p>Nothing, thankful for everything in my life.  Accept for maybe another cat 🙂</p>
<p><strong>28. What was your favorite film of 2010?</strong></p>
<p>I thought the Social Network and Inception were great.  I think Diary of a Wimpy Kid was my fav flick to go see with Aus.</p>
<p><strong>29. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</strong></p>
<p>Vegas Baby.  I was 30, my Mom turned 60.  Ben and my family had a blast.  It was Ben and my first time there.</p>
<p><strong>30. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</strong></p>
<p>Less stress of the little things.  Who ever said don&#8217;t sweat the small stuff is so true.</p>
<p><strong>31. How would you describe your personal fashion concept of 2010?</strong></p>
<p>Sporty Spice!  Casual sneakers and tees with some cute earrings.</p>
<p><strong>32. What kept you sane?</strong></p>
<p>Ben, my kittahs and concerts.  I have to give most of the cred to Ben though.  He&#8217;s my rock.</p>
<p><strong>33. What political issue stirred you the most?</strong></p>
<p>Ummm, it didn&#8217;t stir me per say, but seeing the first African American president in office has been great.</p>
<p><strong>34. Who did you miss?</strong></p>
<p>Aus when he had to spend extended visits at his dad&#8217;s.</p>
<p><strong>35. Who was the best new person you met?</strong></p>
<p>I met a lot of great new co-workers in 2010.</p>
<p><strong>36. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2010.</strong></p>
<p>Laugh A LOT more!</p>
<p><strong>37. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year.</strong></p>
<p><em>I am yours now<br />
So now I don&#8217;t ever have to leave<br />
I&#8217;ve been found out<br />
So now I&#8217;ll never explore<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>-The XX </em></p>
