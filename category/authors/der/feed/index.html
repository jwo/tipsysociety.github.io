		<description><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s no secret for those who know me that I wear flip flops 99% of the time.  It&#8217;s going to need to be REAL cold or REEEAL fancy to get me out of my flops. I ran into<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008BHXLW8/?tag=weea-20+flip+flops"> these</a> at my local Wally World on a random grocery trip and I am really digging them. I typically wear my Sanuk Yoga Mat flip flops, but these are just as comfortable just in a different way. These are less squishy and soft, but they have these massaging bumps in your arch that makes for happy feet as you walk around and I&#8217;m all for that.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I have been using the same make up for over 2 years (Bare Minerals) until I recently stumbled upon this little gem and I swear I will never ever go without it again in my life. It is that good. I have drank the BB cream water and it TASTES GOOD. It boasts that it primes, perfects, hydrates and corrects. My skin actually feels smoother and possibly even less blotchy after using it for a month or so now.  My favorite part is the flawless appearance it gives minus the look and feel of heavy make-up. I like looking done up, but I CAN NOT STAND the way cakey foundation feels on my face. I need light, people. Give it a try. You won&#8217;t regret it. <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2013/04/bb-beautiful/bbcream/" rel="attachment wp-att-9699"><br />

I haven&#8221;t come up with the courage yet, but I will. I have pretty much done every thing there is to do to your hair at home previously, so I have no idea why this scares me&#8230;.but it does. Anyone tried it?? Anyone??</p>

	<p>From the moment I laid eyes on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0098LEZMG/?tag=weea-20+wild+ombre">this</a> on the shelf of Wally World I have been DYING to try it. I haven&#8221;t come up with the courage yet, but I will. I have pretty much done every thing there is to do to your hair at home previously, so I have no idea why this scares me&#8230;.but it does. Anyone tried it?? Anyone??</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I came across these by chance and they have changed my life in the last few years, so I will divulge my secret. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005GBVBCY/?tag=weea-20+mat+flip+flops"> Sanuk Yoga Mat Flip Flops </a>are for reals the best thing that has ever been on my foot. When I HAVE to wear another pair of shoes, I will, but reluctantly. Then I count the seconds until my feet and these shoes can be reunited again.  The soles are the same texture and consistency of a very squishy yoga mat and the straps are super soft. I could walk for hours in these flops and have no complaints regarding my footwear. They come in many varieties and colors, but my personal fav are the leopard print&#8230;. I think they go with everything. Leopard is totally a neutral, at least in my book!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>In Texas big hair is where it&#8217;s at, yáll. I was not blessed with luscious thick locks that naturally plump up the way every Texas girl dreams. My super duper fine hair lays like a limp noodle on my head unless I do a lot, I mean A LOT, of jerseylicious style teasing. Enter hair styling powder. I was first introduced to this in the form of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001CN5S4C/?tag=weea-20+powder"> Osis Dust It</a> and while I love this product it&#8217;s a little steep for my taste as far as price goes for such a tiny container. Low and  behold I have found an almost identical product for under $5!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00546F4CY/?tag=weea-20+styling+powder"> Got2B Volumizing Styling Powder</a> is the BEST! It gives the same effect of the much more expensive powder for a fraction of the cost. I can sprinkle a little of this at my roots and massage or tease it in a little and voila!</p>

It&#8217;s like my lips are baby soft AND the perfect shade of baby pink without looking too matte or too&#8230;how do you say it&#8230; stripper as to me some super light pink glosses tend to look in my opinion.

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Well hello there strangers! I&#8217;m so glad to be back, so so so glad. Let me get right down to it and review 2012 since I fell off the blogosphere for the entire year.</p>
<p>1. What did you do in 2012 that you’d never done before? Become the mother of a GIRL, a beautiful bouncing baby girl!!!</p>
<p>2. Did anyone close to you give birth?me, Id say thats close:)</p>
<p>3. Did anyone close to you die? No, thankfully.</p>
<p>4. What countries did you visit? None, but we did squeeze in a trip to Florida where we took AJ (my now 2 yr old boy) to see the ocean for his very first time. That was such an amazing thing.</p>
<p>5. What would you like to have in 2013 that you lacked in 2012? More time with my husband.. he works a lot and I miss him. So do our kiddos. Sappy, but true.</p>
<p>6. What dates from 2012 will remain etched upon your memory, and why? November 7th. My little girl made her surprising debut a few weeks early. I went in for a regular OB appointment and came out a few days later with a sweet little girl.</p>
<p>7. What was your biggest achievement of the year? Learning how to juggle two kiddos. I&#8217;m still learning, but I think I&#8217;m doing pretty well. Not one single meltdown so far. Im talking about me. My 2 year old has a lot of meltdowns:)</p>
<p>8. What was your biggest failure? I would say losing my temper with my crazed two year old. I love him more than words can express, but I swear he already knows exactly what buttons to push to push me to the brink of my sanity.</p>
<p>9.Did you suffer illness or injury? my daughter came down with a rather scary bout with RSV at 5 weeks old, but thankfully that&#8217;s the extent of our major illnesses this year.</p>
<p>10. What was the best thing you bought? My new car. The kids and I were rolling like a clown car for a few months post baby #2 but now we have room for days thanks to our new SUV.</p>
<p>11.Whose behavior merited celebration? I would have to say&#8230;now bare with me &#8230; my son&#8217;s. I fully expected him to have a very hard time with the new baby in the house, but he is so protective of her and loves to just look at her and talk to her. Just melts my heart to the core. He really is a great big brother.</p>
<p>12. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed? You know I think this person shall remain nameless.</p>
<p>13. What did you get really excited about? Yall, I had a GIRL. Ruffles and bows and rompers and dresses&#8230; a GIRL!!<br />
What song will always remind you of 2012? I think the theme song from Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. My son sings and dances to it and my lord is it the cutest thing ever.</p>
<p>14. Compared to this time last year, are you: a)happier or sadder? happier b)thinner or fatter? fatter c)richer or poorer? richer</p>
<p>15. What do you wish you’d done more of? exercise while I was preggers&#8230;Im paying for it now.</p>
<p>16. What do you wish you’d done less of? Worry&#8230;everything always works out how its supposed to, right?</p>
<p>17. How did you spend Christmas? With the whole fam. My husband often has to work holidays at the fire station, but this year he was all ours for several days!</p>
<p>18. Did you fall in love in 2012? Oh my did I. With my gorgeous daughter, with my son seeing him be such a great brother and growing into such a smart little boy, and with my husband&#8230;something about seeing him hold our babies just does me in.</p>
<p>19. What was your favorite TV program? Modern Family, How I Met Your Mother&#8230; and don&#8217;t judge me, Teen Mom.</p>
<p>20. Do you hate anyone now that you didn’t hate this time last year? No. Hate is such a strong word.</p>
<p>21. What was the best book you read? Um, does Go Dog Go count??</p>
<p>22. What was your greatest musical discovery?Nashville&#8230; dude I know that&#8217;s a show, but it has to do with music and Im HOOKED.</p>
<p>23. What did you want and get? a healthy daughter, a new car</p>
<p>24. What did you want and not get? Nothing really comes to mind that matters.</p>
<p>25. What was your favorite film of this year? I don&#8217;t get to see many movies. Im doing good just to keep up with TV.</p>
<p>26. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you? I turned a ripe old 28 and I went shopping with some of my tipsy gals and sister.</p>
<p>27. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying? More down time with the family. I think we go go go all the time and look up and a month is gone. Sometimes we need to slow it on down.</p>
<p>28. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2012? I feel like most of my jeans of 2012 had holes in them. The on purpose kind. So Im going to say torn up jeans and flip flops. The yoga mat flip flops are my very very best friend.</p>

	<p>Well hello there strangers! I&#8217;m so glad to be back, so so so glad. Let me get right down to it and review 2012 since I fell off the blogosphere for the entire year.</p>
<p>1. What did you do in 2012 that you’d never done before? Become the mother of a GIRL, a beautiful bouncing baby girl!!!</p>
<p>2. Did anyone close to you give birth?me, Id say thats close:)</p>
<p>3. Did anyone close to you die? No, thankfully.</p>
<p>4. What countries did you visit? None, but we did squeeze in a trip to Florida where we took AJ (my now 2 yr old boy) to see the ocean for his very first time. That was such an amazing thing.</p>
<p>5. What would you like to have in 2013 that you lacked in 2012? More time with my husband.. he works a lot and I miss him. So do our kiddos. Sappy, but true.</p>
<p>6. What dates from 2012 will remain etched upon your memory, and why? November 7th. My little girl made her surprising debut a few weeks early. I went in for a regular OB appointment and came out a few days later with a sweet little girl.</p>
<p>7. What was your biggest achievement of the year? Learning how to juggle two kiddos. I&#8217;m still learning, but I think I&#8217;m doing pretty well. Not one single meltdown so far. Im talking about me. My 2 year old has a lot of meltdowns:)</p>
<p>8. What was your biggest failure? I would say losing my temper with my crazed two year old. I love him more than words can express, but I swear he already knows exactly what buttons to push to push me to the brink of my sanity.</p>
<p>9.Did you suffer illness or injury? my daughter came down with a rather scary bout with RSV at 5 weeks old, but thankfully that&#8217;s the extent of our major illnesses this year.</p>
<p>10. What was the best thing you bought? My new car. The kids and I were rolling like a clown car for a few months post baby #2 but now we have room for days thanks to our new SUV.</p>
<p>11.Whose behavior merited celebration? I would have to say&#8230;now bare with me &#8230; my son&#8217;s. I fully expected him to have a very hard time with the new baby in the house, but he is so protective of her and loves to just look at her and talk to her. Just melts my heart to the core. He really is a great big brother.</p>
<p>12. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed? You know I think this person shall remain nameless.</p>
<p>13. What did you get really excited about? Yall, I had a GIRL. Ruffles and bows and rompers and dresses&#8230; a GIRL!!<br />
What song will always remind you of 2012? I think the theme song from Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. My son sings and dances to it and my lord is it the cutest thing ever.</p>
<p>14. Compared to this time last year, are you: a)happier or sadder? happier b)thinner or fatter? fatter c)richer or poorer? richer</p>
<p>15. What do you wish you’d done more of? exercise while I was preggers&#8230;Im paying for it now.</p>
<p>16. What do you wish you’d done less of? Worry&#8230;everything always works out how its supposed to, right?</p>
<p>17. How did you spend Christmas? With the whole fam. My husband often has to work holidays at the fire station, but this year he was all ours for several days!</p>
<p>18. Did you fall in love in 2012? Oh my did I. With my gorgeous daughter, with my son seeing him be such a great brother and growing into such a smart little boy, and with my husband&#8230;something about seeing him hold our babies just does me in.</p>
<p>19. What was your favorite TV program? Modern Family, How I Met Your Mother&#8230; and don&#8217;t judge me, Teen Mom.</p>
<p>20. Do you hate anyone now that you didn’t hate this time last year? No. Hate is such a strong word.</p>
<p>21. What was the best book you read? Um, does Go Dog Go count??</p>
<p>22. What was your greatest musical discovery?Nashville&#8230; dude I know that&#8217;s a show, but it has to do with music and Im HOOKED.</p>
<p>23. What did you want and get? a healthy daughter, a new car</p>
<p>24. What did you want and not get? Nothing really comes to mind that matters.</p>
<p>25. What was your favorite film of this year? I don&#8217;t get to see many movies. Im doing good just to keep up with TV.</p>
<p>26. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you? I turned a ripe old 28 and I went shopping with some of my tipsy gals and sister.</p>
<p>27. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying? More down time with the family. I think we go go go all the time and look up and a month is gone. Sometimes we need to slow it on down.</p>
<p>28. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2012? I feel like most of my jeans of 2012 had holes in them. The on purpose kind. So Im going to say torn up jeans and flip flops. The yoga mat flip flops are my very very best friend.</p>
<p>29. What kept you sane? my mom. She helps me so much with the kids and USUALLY doesnt complain:)</p>
<p>30. Who was the best new person you met? Kenley Kathryn, my sweet little girl</p>
<p>31. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2012. Sometimes people aren&#8217;t meant to stay in your life forever. And it&#8217;s not a bad thing.</p>
