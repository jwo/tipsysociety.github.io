		<description><![CDATA[<p>Remember <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/03/iphone-apps-peekaboo-barn/">Peekaboo Barn</a>? Well the makers of Peekaboo Barn, Night &amp; Day Studios, have created a new app called <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-very-first-app/id392077095?mt=8">My Very First App</a>.  This app is based on Eric Carle&#8217;s <em>My Very First Book of&#8230; Colors, Sounds, Numbers</em>, etc.  The graphics on this app are exactly what you would expect from Eric Carle.  A perk you might not expect from this app is that once you hand this over to your child, they can&#8217;t easily get out of &#8220;play mode&#8221; because they have to press and hold buttons to move around the app to get out of a game.</p>
<p>Night &amp; Day Studios has so graciously decided to giveaway this awesome new app to two lucky Tipsy readers.</p>
<p>If you want to enter the giveaway, leave a comment letting us know which Eric Carle book is your child&#8217;s absolute fav!</p>
<p>The Rules<em><em></em></em></p>
<p><em><em>One entry per person. </em><em>No entries after 5:00 pm Central Time Wednesday.  Winners will be randomly selected from among entrants. </em><em>Winners will be announced at 9:00 am Central Time Thursday.</em></em></p>

<blockquote><p>I have four kids and a dog that I chauffeur all over town in my minivan. I would use the tote as a catch all to keep everyones “stuff” from rolling around in the car.  It also looks big enough to put a picnic dinner in for my large family.</p></blockquote>
<p>Charing gave us an update on what bag she chose and sent along a picture.  We thought it was TOO CUTE and wanted to share with the other Tipsy Readers!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve talked <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/04/iphone-apps-livestrong/">before</a> about how my husband and I use a <a href="http://zenofitness.com/">trainer</a>. My husband and I used to workout together and then I got all preggo and we had to split up our workouts because I had to take it down a few notches on the workout front.  Since our kiddo was born we&#8217;ve still kept our workouts separate and since then Zeno has moved to a different gym and we followed him. Because we LOVE HIM! He&#8217;s really not the drill sargeant type at all&#8230;he listens, he knows when you can do more and he knows when you are DONE.  And because Zeno loves us, he&#8217;s decided to give one lucky Tipsy reader 2 free personal training sessions.</p>
<p>So if you are in the Houston area and you want to win two free sessions with Zeno or you are <em>going to be</em> in the Houston area sometime soon and want to win two free sessions with Zeno leave a comment letting us know what you hate most about working out.</p>
<p>The Rules<em><em></em></em></p>
<p><em><em>One entry per person. </em><em>No entries after 5:00 pm Central Time Friday.  Winners will be randomly selected from among entrants. </em><em>Winners will be announced at 9:00 am Central Time Monday.</em></em><br />
<strong>Congratulations Kenny!  You are the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">next victim for Zeno</span> WINNER!  We&#8217;ll be emailing you with Zeno&#8217;s info so you can go get your sweat on!  Thanks to everyone for entering.<br />
