		<description><![CDATA[<p>So we all know I&#8217;m a fan of Soma Intimates right? You didn&#8217;t? <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/02/tipsy-favs-bra-edition/">Catch up please</a>!  So when I came to the realization that my strapless bra was hanging onto its last leg I decided to hit up my local Soma store and see what they had to offer.  I asked for a recommendation and was told <a href="http://www.soma.com/store/browse/product.jsp?maxRec=6&amp;pageId=1&amp;productId=500000391&amp;viewAll=&amp;prd=Eva+Unlined+Strapless+Bra&amp;subCatId=cat2770019&amp;color=&amp;fromSearch=&amp;inSeam=&amp;posId=2&amp;catId=cat40089&amp;cat=Bras+Strapless&amp;onSale=&amp;colorFamily=&amp;maxPg=1&amp;size=">this was the most comfortable strapless bra.</a> I was all ok ok sure I&#8217;ll try that one, what else you got?  So I made my way into the dressing (ramming the stroller into all the walls to get it maneuvered in) and tried on what turned out to be TRUE! I&#8217;m telling you this really is super comfy.  It has these silicon strips at the top and bottom to hold everything in place and it holds the girls up AND it manages to be comfortable at the same time.  For the record I&#8217;m not a flat chester so this will work for even you big bosomed gals.  I not only purchased the soft tan but the black also because it was THAT worth it.  And you know what? It&#8217;s on sale! Run! Don&#8217;t walk!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>So me and my Tipsy Girl <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/court/" target="_blank">Court</a> have been on a work out kick for the past 8 or 9 weeks. We joined our local <a href="http://www.ymca.net/" target="_blank">YMCA</a> and have been doing everything from spinning to boot camp, to basic cardio and weights. The main thing that we&#8217;ve taken away from our workouts is a) it&#8217;s nice to have a friend that keeps you honest and makes you go to workout, even when you don&#8217;t want to and b) the Y has given us an outlet for our ADD selves so we don&#8217;t get bored.</p>

<p>These are some of my workout basics:</p>
