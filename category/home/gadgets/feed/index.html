		<description><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m in the midst of a complete closet overhaul.  I have a lot of stuff to get rid of and I also have a lot of things I want to reorganize.  I&#8217;ve been searching pinterest and googling tips and organization tools to get my closet all spiffed up.  One of the ideas I ran across was to use a regular old bath robe or bath towel hook for your belts.  So I headed to my neighborhood Target and instead of getting the regular bath/towel hook I had planned on, I ran across <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000M3THK4/?tag=weea-20">these</a> and thought it might be even better.  So far so good! There were different sizes that will hold different weights.  If you decide to go this route you might want to take into account that you can&#8217;t hang a tiny belt on the wide hook, so you might want to get different sizes for different belts, but man otherwise, this is getting my organizational juices going!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>We had a great Christmas! My husband and I think this year has been the best so far in terms of celebrating with our son.  He got excited to hand out gifts and open gifts and play with everything.  It was super fun.  Here are a few things I got for Christmas this year:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.brookstone.com/ultrasonic-jewelry-cleaner-dvd-cleaners.html?his=2%7E46337%7E2%7Eroot_category%40kwd%7Ejewelry&amp;bkiid=searchResults|C4CategoryProdList1FDT|8417281">Jewelry Cleaner</a>, Brookstone-If you&#8217;ve ever thought about getting one of these things, do it! Do it now! All you do is add water and it uses sound waves to clean everything.  I immediately did my wedding ring and watch and embarrassed at the amount of gunk that came off both of them.  And I THOUGHT I kept them clean.  This also does eyeglasses, which I haven&#8217;t done yet but am psyched to do.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.jcrew.com/womens_category/sweaters/cardigans/PRDOVR~29350/29350.jsp">Jackie cardigan</a>, J.Crew-I love these cardigans and buy them at the outlet store or ask for them as gifts.  I&#8217;m a cardigan addict.  I received navy and cerise for Christmas.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.katespade.com/product/index.jsp?productId=4075994&amp;cp=4335762.2065600">iPhone Case</a>, Kate Spade-I was in need of a new case and received one like this and it&#8217;s right up my alley what with all the colors!!</li>
<li><a href="http://store.apple.com/us/personalize/apple?mco=MTc0MjU2MDE&amp;product=MA210">Apple gift card</a>, Apple-In combination with my husband we received enough apple gift cards to purchase an iPad.  However after a twitter questionnaire we&#8217;ve decided to wait on the next version to come out before we buy it.  I think that&#8217;s in April.  I think.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000W8V4WS/?tag=weea-20">iSi Flexible Mixing Bowls</a>, Amazon-A month or so ago, in an effort to do something in the kitchen, I gave my son a couple of mixing bowls and a wooden spoon to occupy him.  That turned into me needing new bowls.  I don&#8217;t think these will break.</li>
</ol>
<p>The best gift of all might be what Santa brought my son.  He loves it more than anything and it gives his parents a chance to sit and chill for a few minutes. <a href="http://www.walmart.com/ip/Little-Star-Bouncer/10172315">Little Star Bouncer</a>, Walmart</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s that time again! Christmas is sneaking up on us and we tipsy gals have been pretty damn good this year if I don&#8217;t say so myself. When I sent my letter to Santa, here is what was on it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Amazon, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002JVWQSW/?tag=weea-20">Modern Family Season 1</a>&#8211; I can&#8217;t sing this show&#8217;s praises enough and I totally want to own this so I can re-watch it over and over.</li>
<li>Nordstrom, <a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3037175?origin=keywordsearch&amp;resultback=300">Michael Kors Chronograph Watch</a>&#8211; I haven&#8217;t owned an actual watch of value since I couldn&#8217;t tell you when. And I know there are much more pricey pieces available, but since I&#8217;ve been out of the game for a some time&#8230; I&#8217;ll start off easy.</li>
<li>Express, <a href="http://www.express.com/essential-stretch-military-shirt-23572-721.pro?Mcatn=Shirts&amp;Mpper=3&amp;Mcatp=cat_2&amp;Mcat=721&amp;Mpos=1&amp;Mcatg=category_root&amp;Mpg=SEARCH%2BNAV&amp;Mcatpn=For+Her&amp;user_att_name=Interest&amp;user_att_value=Email&amp;Mrsaa=*&amp;Mrsavf=*&amp;Mppg=0#jsLink">Essential Stretch Military Shirt</a>&#8211; I am a HUGE fan of the military trend and the stretch in this top would allow room for the ladies if ya know what I mean.</li>
<li>Etsy, <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/52599588/sterling-silver-fingerprint-necklace?ref=sr_gallery_23&amp;ga_search_query=fingerprint+necklace&amp;ga_search_type=handmade&amp;ga_page=&amp;order=&amp;includes[0]=tags&amp;includes[1]=title&amp;filter[0]=handmade">Finger Print Necklace</a>&#8211; I would love to preserve and wear my new little man&#8217;s finger print around my neck daily. It&#8217;s such a unique keepsake that I would cherish forever.</li>
<li>Amazon, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0047R2EJC/?tag=weea-20">Hobo International Metallic Lauren Wallet</a> &#8211; I adore my hobo lauren wallet that I have, but it honestly has seen better days. I really like the metallic version for my upgrade.</li>
<li>Amazon, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003UWUC9E/?tag=weea-20">Raspberry Converse</a>&#8211; Since the purchase of my very first pair of converse, I am wanting to own every color of the rainbow and these are the perfect shade of pink.</li>
<li>Kohls, <a href="http://www.kohls.com/kohlsStore/landingpages/foodnetwork_new/prep/electrics/PRD~517211/Deni+Digital+3Tier+Stainless+Steel+Food+Steamer.jsp?crosssell=true">Deni Digital Stainless Steel Steamer</a>&#8211; Steamed veggies are where it&#8217;s at in my book, so I think this is right up my alley.</li>
<li>Timi and Leslie, <a href="http://www.timiandleslie.com/products/baby-jane/">Baby Jane Bag</a>&#8211; I LOVE my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002VK0CKK/?tag=weea-20">current diaper bag</a> so much, but a gal can never have too many bags, right? I love the sleekness of this bag and I would totally rock this with or without my baby.</li>
<li>Gap, <a href="http://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=37455&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=788194">Plaid Flannel Pajamas</a>&#8211; I have always wanted a classic set of jammies to kick it in during the winter months.</li>
<li>Amazon, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001VA8PWI/?tag=weea-20">Bare Escentuals Starter Kit</a>&#8211; I have always wanted to give this stuff a go. I have never used any type of mineral make-up before, but those infomercials sure do sell me.</li>
