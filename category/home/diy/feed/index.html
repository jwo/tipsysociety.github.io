I haven&#8221;t come up with the courage yet, but I will. I have pretty much done every thing there is to do to your hair at home previously, so I have no idea why this scares me&#8230;.but it does. Anyone tried it?? Anyone??</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>We received a comment on our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/tipsysociety" target="_blank">Facebook</a> page recently asking about some inexpensive options for a  &#8220;Denim and Diamonds&#8221; themed party, and here&#8217;s what we came up with!</p>
<ul>
<li>Mason jars w/ tea lights:  from <a href="http://emmalinebride.com/handmade-wedding/mason-jar-centerpieces-floating-candles/" target="_blank">http://emmalinebride.com/handmade-wedding/mason-jar-centerpieces-floating-candles/</a>. We would replace those clear marbles with diamondy things.</li>
<li> Baby&#8217;s breath in galvanized tubs (large or small): from <a href="http://global.theknot.com/join/MemberLogin.aspx?target=http%3a%2f%2fweddings.theknot.com%2fReal-Weddings%2f85011%2fdetailview.aspx%3fSTOPREDIRECTING%3dTRUE%26id%3d85011%26type%3d3%26wedding%2bdetails%3dceremony%2bdecor%26PgReferrer%3d" target="_blank">theknot.com</a>. After all, baby&#8217;s breath is CHEAP!</li>
<li>Flowers in vintage cans: from <a href="http://peacockfeatherevents.blogspot.com/2009/10/wedding-wild-flowers.html" target="_blank">http://peacockfeatherevents.blogspot.com/2009/10/wedding-wild-flowers.html</a>. You could also just take regular cans and cover the cans with either scrapbook or brown paper, which might be easier to find if you don&#8217;t have vintage cans on hand.</li>
<li>Flowers, curly willow, and raffia in clear vases: from <a href="http://jenelisebeth.blogspot.com/2009/07/etsy-martha-stewart-handmade-weddings.html" target="_blank">http://jenelisebeth.blogspot.com/2009/07/etsy-martha-stewart-handmade-weddings.html</a>. We would replace the yellow with something that matches the colors of the party.</li>
<li>Mason jars, twine, and flowers: from <a href="http://wedding.allwomenstalk.com/5-rustic-wedding-centerpiece-ideas/" target="_blank">http://wedding.allwomenstalk.com/5-rustic-wedding-centerpiece-ideas/</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div>Hope this helps&#8230;keep us posted on what you end up using!</div>

Well I did some semi-homemade ones&#8230;I had every intention of going and buying the felt to actually sew the stockings but when I got to my fabric store lo and behold they had basic red felt stockings that I could use as a base to start with.  So I bought 4 of those puppies and some rick rack and felt squares.  I had purchased two ornaments (an owl and a hedgehog) to put on the pockets of the boys&#8217; stockings the week before.  So I got to work and ended up just hot glueing the majority of the project.  My plan for next year is to actually embroider their names on by hand (<a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/228557749808608074/">inspired by this</a>), but for now I&#8217;m just going to use the initials.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Have you heard of this site? <a href="http://honestlywtf.com/">Honestly WTF</a> is a site I stumbled upon recently and I&#8217;m LOVING their DIY tutorials, specifically on bracelets.  The photo above are some of the ones that inspired me to get my craft on.</p>
<p><a href="http://honestlywtf.com/diy/diy-braided-hex-nut-bracelet/">DIY Braided Hex Nut Bracelet</a><br />
<a href="http://honestlywtf.com/diy/diy-rope-bracelet/">DIY Rope Bracelet</a><br />
<a href="http://honestlywtf.com/diy/diy-friendship-bracelet/">DIY Friendship Bracelet</a></p>
<p>Here is what I ended up with! They were pretty easy! The only ones that gave me a hard time were the rope bracelets, I could not wrap my head around how to tie that adjustable knot, but I finally got it right after several tries. The friendship bracelet, while it took a long time, it was pretty relaxing to sit and do while I watched Celebrity Rehab.  And you guessed it, I did not have rhinestones, but I did have turquoise beads (shocker).</p>
<p>The turquoise/green and shades of grey bracelets idea was found in the comments of Honestly WTF and you can find that tutorial <a href="http://www.iamvintagelover.com/diy-friendship-bracelets">here</a>. I can&#8217;t wait to figure out how to mix and match these with other bracelets I have.  What DIY stuff have you been doing recently?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I recently shared with you my unusual method of necklace storage, so I thought I would now share my ingenious method of hat storage. You see, I have a lot of hats. I have learned from experience that sunburnt scalps suck so if I spend any amount of time in the sun (which is all the time in spring and summer) I will have a hat on my head. While trying to figure out a way to cleverly store my hats without crushing them, I happened upon  some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GJAL4K/?tag=weea-20">tie back hooks</a> I had leftover from hanging curtains. There in lies my genius. You can just screw them into the wall and hang up your hat. They come in packages of 6 for about $1, and you can usually make more than one hat fit on each hook.  Like I said, ingenious.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>And they hold my necklaces. Gotcha! Seriously though, using a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GPVDLE/?tag=weea-20">tie rack</a> as necklace storage might be the best idea I have ever had. Actually I stole it from my old roommate, so it wasn&#8217;t my idea at all. But it might be the best idea anyone has had. You can get a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GPVDLE/?tag=weea-20">tie rack</a> for around 5 bucks so there is no need to be wasting money on the expensive ones unless you are going for looks. (Obviously I was not if that picture is any indication). Just screw it into your closet wall and BAM! Cheap, easy storage.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m a huge fan of giving the gift of a class or experience.  It&#8217;s probably not the first thing you think of but they are a huge hit and so fun.  Here&#8217;s some ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>One year my mom got my dad a new fancy schmancy camera, so I got him a class on how to use that camera.  Give the gift of a photography class.</li>
<li>My husband loves to cook, last year I had a local chef come to our house to teach him how to make a classic french meal.  Give a private or group cooking class!</li>
<li>How bout skydiving!  If you are willing to do a tandem jump you don&#8217;t have to be there for some 8 hour class to learn how to jump on your own.</li>
<li>Knitting/Crocheting/Sewing classes&#8230;last year I got a sewing machine and also got a &#8220;Get to Know your Sewing Machine&#8221; class.  It was awesome.  I&#8217;m hoping this year I&#8217;ll relearn crocheting.</li>
<li>Guitar Lessons was a gift my dad gave my mom one year.</li>
<li>Wine Tasting! Learn more about wine and get a little Tipsy at the same time!</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you give these types of gifts? If so, what have you given? I&#8217;d love to hear!!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I am a pretty regular participant in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/theworkingcloset/">The Working Closet flickr pool</a> and an avid reader of <a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/workingcloset/">The Working Closet blog</a>. The gist is that you post your everyday looks, so you can inspire others and gain inspirations for what to wear daily. I enjoy it and think its a great way to make you think about shopping your own closet.</p>
<p>Last week I posted a tee that I wore and happened to have made myself.</p>
<p>This is the tee that started it all:</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-750 alignnone" title="orig" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/orig.jpg" alt="orig" width="416" height="500" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/orig.jpg 416w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/orig-249x300.jpg 249w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></p>
<p>The wonderful Susan of The Working Closet  and <a href="http://www.fridayplaydate.com/">Friday Playdate</a> asked me kindly to create a tutorial of how I made my tees. They are a great way to make new of your old tiresome things and extend your wardrobe, thus saving money on shopping sprees.</p>
<p>Here is a step by step tutorial on a double ruffle neck tee:</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-749 alignnone" title="supplies" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/supplies.jpg" alt="supplies" width="416" height="500" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/supplies.jpg 416w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/supplies-249x300.jpg 249w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></p>
<p>Supplies: a tee (any neck will do), approximately 2 yards of ruffled or pleated ribbon or blanket/quilt binding, pins, and a needle and thread (you could definitely do this on a sewing machine as well)</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-751 alignnone" title="step 1" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-1.jpg" alt="step 1" width="416" height="500" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-1.jpg 416w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-1-249x300.jpg 249w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></p>
<p>Step 1:  Pin your ribbon right along the edge of the neck band on the tee. Pin all the way around the entire band.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-765" title="step 2" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-2.jpg" alt="step 2" width="416" height="500" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-2.jpg 416w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-2-249x300.jpg 249w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></p>
<p>Step 2:  Stitch along the top area of the ribbon</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-766" title="step 3" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-3.jpg" alt="step 3" width="416" height="500" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-3.jpg 416w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-3-249x300.jpg 249w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></p>
<p>Step 3:  Continue your stitching under the neck band all the way around the tee, including the back. Then cut your ribbon off once you have made it all the way around.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-767" title="step 4" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-4.jpg" alt="step 4" width="416" height="500" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-4.jpg 416w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-4-249x300.jpg 249w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></p>
<p>Step 4:  Lay the next layer of ribbon right at the top of the neck band and pin all the way around.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-768" title="step 5" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-5.jpg" alt="step 5" width="416" height="500" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-5.jpg 416w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-5-249x300.jpg 249w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></p>
<p>Step 5:  Stitch this layer of ruffle the exact same way you did before, being a little more cautious since this layer will not be covered with another layer. Cut your ribbon off once you have made it all the way around.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-769" title="admire 1" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/admire-1.jpg" alt="admire 1" width="416" height="500" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/admire-1.jpg 416w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/admire-1-249x300.jpg 249w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></p>
<p>Step 6:  Step back and admire your work</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-770" title="admire 2" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/admire-2.jpg" alt="admire 2" width="416" height="500" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/admire-2.jpg 416w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/admire-2-249x300.jpg 249w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></p>
<p>Here I am modeling the tee&#8230; it is so easy and such a cute way to update a plain tshirt in a very inexpensive way.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-771" title="complete" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/complete.jpg" alt="complete" width="416" height="500" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/complete.jpg 416w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/complete-249x300.jpg 249w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-751 alignnone" title="step 1" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-1.jpg" alt="step 1" width="416" height="500" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-1.jpg 416w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-1-249x300.jpg 249w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></p>
<p>Step 1:  Pin your ribbon right along the edge of the neck band on the tee. Pin all the way around the entire band.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-765" title="step 2" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-2.jpg" alt="step 2" width="416" height="500" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-2.jpg 416w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-2-249x300.jpg 249w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></p>
<p>Step 2:  Stitch along the top area of the ribbon</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-766" title="step 3" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-3.jpg" alt="step 3" width="416" height="500" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-3.jpg 416w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-3-249x300.jpg 249w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></p>
<p>Step 3:  Continue your stitching under the neck band all the way around the tee, including the back. Then cut your ribbon off once you have made it all the way around.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-767" title="step 4" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-4.jpg" alt="step 4" width="416" height="500" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-4.jpg 416w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-4-249x300.jpg 249w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></p>
<p>Step 4:  Lay the next layer of ribbon right at the top of the neck band and pin all the way around.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-768" title="step 5" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-5.jpg" alt="step 5" width="416" height="500" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-5.jpg 416w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-5-249x300.jpg 249w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></p>
<p>Step 5:  Stitch this layer of ruffle the exact same way you did before, being a little more cautious since this layer will not be covered with another layer. Cut your ribbon off once you have made it all the way around.</p>

<p>Step 6:  Step back and admire your work</p>

<p>Here I am modeling the tee&#8230; it is so easy and such a cute way to update a plain tshirt in a very inexpensive way.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am a pretty regular participant in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/theworkingcloset/">The Working Closet flickr pool</a> and an avid reader of <a href="http://www.workitmom.com/bloggers/workingcloset/">The Working Closet blog</a>. The gist is that you post your everyday looks, so you can inspire others and gain inspirations for what to wear daily. I enjoy it and think its a great way to make you think about shopping your own closet.</p>
<p>Last week I posted a tee that I wore and happened to have made myself.</p>
<p>This is the tee that started it all:</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-750 alignnone" title="orig" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/orig.jpg" alt="orig" width="416" height="500" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/orig.jpg 416w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/orig-249x300.jpg 249w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></p>
<p>The wonderful Susan of The Working Closet  and <a href="http://www.fridayplaydate.com/">Friday Playdate</a> asked me kindly to create a tutorial of how I made my tees. They are a great way to make new of your old tiresome things and extend your wardrobe, thus saving money on shopping sprees.</p>
<p>Here is a step by step tutorial on a double ruffle neck tee:</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-749 alignnone" title="supplies" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/supplies.jpg" alt="supplies" width="416" height="500" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/supplies.jpg 416w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/supplies-249x300.jpg 249w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></p>
<p>Supplies: a tee (any neck will do), approximately 2 yards of ruffled or pleated ribbon or blanket/quilt binding, pins, and a needle and thread (you could definitely do this on a sewing machine as well)</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-751 alignnone" title="step 1" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-1.jpg" alt="step 1" width="416" height="500" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-1.jpg 416w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-1-249x300.jpg 249w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></p>
<p>Step 1:  Pin your ribbon right along the edge of the neck band on the tee. Pin all the way around the entire band.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-765" title="step 2" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-2.jpg" alt="step 2" width="416" height="500" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-2.jpg 416w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-2-249x300.jpg 249w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></p>
<p>Step 2:  Stitch along the top area of the ribbon</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-766" title="step 3" src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-3.jpg" alt="step 3" width="416" height="500" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-3.jpg 416w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/step-3-249x300.jpg 249w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></p>

<p>Step 4:  Lay the next layer of ribbon right at the top of the neck band and pin all the way around.</p>
