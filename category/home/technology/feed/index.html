		<description><![CDATA[<p>Aside from the apps from Night &#038; Day Studios that we told you about yesterday (have you entered the <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2011/09/giveaway-apps-for-kids/">giveaway</a> yet?) I&#8217;ve got a couple of new favorites that I wanted to tell you about.</p>
<p>First, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/montessori-approach-to-geography/id404180273?mt=8">Montessori Approach to Geography-United States of America</a>.<br />
<img src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ak-ipad-apps.png" alt="" title="ak-ipad apps" width="500" height="752" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9057" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ak-ipad-apps.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ak-ipad-apps-199x300.png 199w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />This app is pretty great at giving your kiddo some basic info about the states and allowing them to puzzle them together to form the United States. My son has been working with this app for a couple of weeks now and he&#8217;s definitely got a lot of the states down by shape.  He especially likes to say TEXAS!!</p>
<p>Next, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bob-books-1-reading-magic-hd/id405995002?mt=8">Bob Books</a> (There&#8217;s a #1 and #2)<br />
<img src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ak-ipad-apps-2.png" alt="" title="ak-ipad apps 2" width="500" height="672" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9058" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ak-ipad-apps-2.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ak-ipad-apps-2-223x300.png 223w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />This app is not just iPad friendly, it&#8217;s also for iPhone and iTouch. It&#8217;s a phonics based educational game. Your child will see a very basic sentence. They can hear the sentence, then they can put the letters together and hear each letter and how it makes up the word.  Pretty great for early/first readers.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Hey everybody, we&#8217;ve got a little giveaway today! I am definitely always on the hunt for some good iPhone or iPad apps for my kiddos.  I&#8217;ve got some favorites that I am going to tell you about tomorrow, however today I am going to tell you about some brand new apps by Night &amp; Day Studios!!</p>
<p>First up&#8230;<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/caillous-world-for-ipad/id463080119?mt=8">Caillou&#8217;s World for iPad</a><br />
<img src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ak-caillous-world.png" alt="" title="ak-caillous world" width="500" height="740" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9051" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ak-caillous-world.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ak-caillous-world-202x300.png 202w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><br />
Caillou&#8217;s World will show your child a scene in black and white and then highlight in color a specific object.  They then have to decide what letter that object starts with.  After they do this a few times the whole picture will show up in full color.  Your child will be overjoyed at this point. LOL!! </p>
<p>Next up&#8230;<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/peekaboo-barn-for-ipad/id465731441?mt=8">Peekaboo Barn</a>!<br />
<img src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ak-peekaboo-barn.png" alt="" title="ak-peekaboo barn" width="500" height="744" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9052" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ak-peekaboo-barn.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ak-peekaboo-barn-201x300.png 201w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><br />
Remember when we told you about <a href="http://tipsysociety.com/2010/03/iphone-apps-peekaboo-barn/">Peekaboo Barn</a>? Well y&#8217;all it&#8217;s totally revamped! More languages! And my absolute favorite feature&#8230;record your own voice! The possibilities of the record your own voice thing you guys! Grandparents could record, Parents, an older sibling?! </p>
<p>Lastly, I want to tell you about <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/richard-scarrys-busytown-hd/id463858993?mt=8">Richard Scarry&#8217;s Busytown</a>.<br />
<img src="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ak-scarry-busy-town.png" alt="" title="ak-scarry busy town" width="500" height="752" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9053" srcset="http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ak-scarry-busy-town.png 500w, http://tipsysociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ak-scarry-busy-town-199x300.png 199w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><br />
I am super excited to try this app out with the kiddo.  You can dress characters, you can explore rooms and touch and interact with different items on the screen.  My first impression of this is that it&#8217;s similar to those Look &#038; Find books you see&#8230;try and find this item type of thing.  My son LOVES those kind of things, so I&#8217;m super pumped to play this with him.</p>
<p>So there you have it! Night &#038; Day Studios has so graciously decided to giveaway one of each of these new apps to one lucky Tipsy reader.</p>
<p>If you want to enter the giveaway, leave a comment letting us know which device you would use it on, your iPhone or iPad.</p>
<p><em>The Rules</p>
<p>One entry per person. No entries after 5:00 pm Central Time Friday.  Winners will be randomly selected from among entrants. Winners will be announced Monday.</em></p>

<p>How cool is that?! I think this is PERFECT for grandparents and other relatives for instagrams of your kids OR a perfect way to create your own postcard from a trip you are currently on.  Uber cool!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>So, my better half got an iPad.  The kiddo has renamed the iPad &#8220;the big phone&#8221; because most of the games he can play on our iPhones he can now play on the iPad.  One of those games is <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/preschool-memory-match/id368542467?mt=8">Preschool Memory Match</a> and what I LOVE about it is that each game is different and it says the name of whatever is behind the card out loud whether it&#8217;s an animal or musical instrument or whatever.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/AWo/status/54993895188205568">The downside of this game</a>:</p>

Do you use it a ton and if so how has it worked for you thus far?  We have TiVo and will at times rent movies from Amazon Video on Demand and download them to the TiVo.  Other times we watch stuff on the TiVo&#8217;s Netflix streaming.  The Netflix streaming sucks a bit because it times out here and there and can be very frustrating.  I&#8217;m curious for those of you that have Apple TV, does yours time out?  We are just wondering if we need to add an Apple TV to our home.  What say you?</p>
